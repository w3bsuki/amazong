# i18n Lane Audit — 2026-01-20

## Evidence (commands + outputs)

- Key parity (leaf keys): `codex-xhigh/i18n/messages-parity-2026-01-20.log`
  - Missing in `en.json`: 7 keys (listed in the log)
- Files containing Cyrillic in code (non-JSON): `codex-xhigh/i18n/cyrillic-files-2026-01-20.txt`
- Inline locale checks / hardcoded strings: `codex-xhigh/i18n/inline-locale-checks-2026-01-20.txt`

## Critical (blocks execution)

- [ ] `messages/en.json` / `messages/bg.json` key parity mismatch → add the 7 missing keys to `messages/en.json` (see `codex-xhigh/i18n/messages-parity-2026-01-20.log`).

## High

- [ ] Inline locale branching exists in many places (metadata + UI strings) → migrate to `next-intl` patterns per `docs/FRONTEND.md` (see `codex-xhigh/i18n/inline-locale-checks-2026-01-20.txt`).

## Deferred

- [ ] Large Cyrillic footprint in code likely includes acceptable domain constants, but still needs manual triage (see `codex-xhigh/i18n/cyrillic-files-2026-01-20.txt`).
