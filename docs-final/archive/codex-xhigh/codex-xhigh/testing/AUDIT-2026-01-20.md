# Testing Lane Audit — 2026-01-20

## Evidence (commands + outputs)

- Unit tests: `codex-xhigh/testing/unit-2026-01-20.log` (✅ 399 passed)
- E2E smoke: `codex-xhigh/testing/e2e-smoke-2026-01-20.log` (✅ 16 passed)

## Critical (blocks execution)

- None (smoke + unit both green in this run)

## High

- [ ] Some tests log expected error paths to stderr (noise) → decide if we want to silence those logs in unit tests post-ship (see `codex-xhigh/testing/unit-2026-01-20.log`).
