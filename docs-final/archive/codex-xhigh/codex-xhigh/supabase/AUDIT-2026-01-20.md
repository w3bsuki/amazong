# Supabase Lane Audit — 2026-01-20

## Evidence (commands + outputs)

- Full log: `codex-xhigh/logs/2026-01-20-supabase.md`

## Critical (blocks execution)

- [ ] Supabase Dashboard: enable leaked password protection → see `docs/PRODUCTION.md` (this is `P1-SUPA-05` on the board).

## High

- [ ] Performance advisor “RLS initplan” warnings are deferred (admin-only tables) → see `codex-xhigh/logs/2026-01-20-supabase.md`.

## Verified (done in this lane)

- ✅ Required migrations applied in production (avatars bucket, stock fix, order status fix)
- ✅ Security Advisor actionable warnings resolved (2 accepted warnings remain; 1 is dashboard-only)
- ✅ Storage buckets/policies verified (`avatars`, `product-images`)
- ✅ `validate_username` drift resolved (single canonical definition)
