# Docs Archive (Not Maintained)

This folder contains historical planning notes, audits, and superseded docs that were moved out of `docs/` to keep the active documentation surface area small.

If you need something from here, treat it as reference-only and migrate the relevant pieces into one of the canonical docs:

- `docs/PRODUCTION.md`
- `docs/ENGINEERING.md`
- `docs/DESIGN.md`
- `docs/TESTING.md`
- `docs/README.md`
