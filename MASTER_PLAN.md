# Master Plan (Index)

This file is intentionally an index only.

Execution entrypoint:
- Phase 0: docs/planning/PHASE_0_FOUNDATION_AND_FULL_AUDIT.md

Phase plan files (created during Phase 0):
- Phase 1: docs/planning/PHASE_1_FRONTEND_UX_UI.md
- Phase 2: docs/planning/PHASE_2_SUPABASE_BACKEND_TYPES.md
- Phase 3: docs/planning/PHASE_3_NEXTJS_APP_ROUTER_BEST_PRACTICES.md
- Phase 4: docs/planning/PHASE_4_PRODUCTION_PLAYWRIGHT_RELEASE.md

How to run in a new chat:
- “Read Phase 0 and execute it. Don’t refactor yet—only produce outputs and baselines.”
