# Replace Me

## Overview

Explain in 1–2 sentences what this skill enables.

## Non-negotiables

- State the important repo constraints the agent must follow.
- Keep these concrete (paths, conventions, tooling).

## Workflow

1. Identify the right location(s) to change.
2. Make the smallest safe change that satisfies the request.
3. Validate with the appropriate gate (typecheck/tests) when relevant.

## Resources

If you add more files to this skill, list them here with when to use them:

- `references/…` — Load when you need deeper rules or schemas.
- `scripts/…` — Run when you need deterministic validation or generation.
- `assets/…` — Copy/modify when you need boilerplate templates.

## Examples (should trigger)

- “…”
- “…”
