## Status

**BLOCKED** — Domain 6 covers lib/, actions/, api/ (169 files, 26.3K LOC). Contains payment and auth action refactors that need human sign-off before execution.

## What's Done

Domains 1-5 and 7 are complete (32 sessions). Safe refactors in Domain 6 are done. Only auth/payment-sensitive refactors remain.

## To Unblock

Human reviews `refactor/domains/06-lib-actions-api.md`, approves the approach for auth/payment action refactors, then this task moves to TASKS.md as an executable Codex task.
