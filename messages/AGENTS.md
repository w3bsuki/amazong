# messages/ — Translation Messages Rules

These rules apply to everything under `messages/`.

## Non‑negotiables

- Keep `en` and `bg` keys in sync (no missing translations).
- Do not delete/rename keys unless all call sites are updated in the same batch.
- Values are user-facing copy: no placeholders, no debug strings.
