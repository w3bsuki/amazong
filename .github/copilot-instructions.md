# Copilot Instructions (Treido)

Read `AGENTS.md` in the project root — project identity, conventions, rules, verification commands, and context loading.

For deeper context, see the documentation map in `AGENTS.md § Deep Context`.
For feature-specific context, check `docs/features/<feature>.md` if it exists.
For refactoring work, read `REFACTOR.md`.
