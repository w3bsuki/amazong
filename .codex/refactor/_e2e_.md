# Folder: `e2e/`

Status: Not audited

## Why this folder exists (expected)

Playwright E2E specs and helpers. Should be stable, minimal, and focused on critical flows.

## Audit checklist

- [ ] Inventory e2e tests and identify critical smoke subset.
- [ ] Remove duplicated helpers and flaky selectors.
- [ ] Ensure tests cover refactor-risky flows (auth, checkout, listing, search).
