# Folder: `.github/`

Status: Not audited

## Why this folder exists (expected)

CI workflows, issue templates, repo automation. This should be lean and not duplicated elsewhere.

## Audit checklist

- [ ] Inventory workflows and which ones actually run.
- [ ] Remove dead workflows and duplicated scripts.
- [ ] Ensure secrets are only in GitHub Secrets (not repo).
- [ ] Ensure CI does not scan tool/IDE folders unnecessarily.

## Subagent prompt (copy/paste)

```text
AUDIT FOLDER: .github/
Goal: simplify CI + remove unused workflows/config.
Output: Inventory + delete candidates + risks + verification.
```
