# Folder: `scripts/`

Status: Not audited

## Why this folder exists (expected)

Dev/ops scripts (build, validate, migrations, etc). Should be minimal and documented.

## Audit checklist

- [ ] Inventory scripts and identify dead ones.
- [ ] Ensure scripts do not depend on local tool folders.
- [ ] Consolidate duplicated scripts across folders.
