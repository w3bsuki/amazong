# Folder: `.agent/`

Status: Done — **DELETE** (duplicate skills pack)

## What it is

This folder is a duplicated “AI skills pack”:
- It contains only `skills/` (no unique config files).
- The `skills/*` set is **identical** to `.agents/skills` and also appears duplicated in multiple tool folders (`.claude/skills`, `.cursor/skills`, `.gemini/skills`, `.kiro/skills`, `.qoder/skills`, `.qwen/skills`, `.trae/skills`, `.windsurf/skills`, `.github/skills`).

## Evidence

- Contents: `.agent/skills/*` only.
- Skill names match `.agents/skills` 1:1 (15 skills).
- Sample diff shows no differences (files are byte-identical): `git diff --no-index .agent/skills/playwright/SKILL.md .agents/skills/playwright/SKILL.md` (no output).

## Decision

Delete `.agent/` entirely.
- Canonical copy (if we keep this generic skill pack at all): `.agents/skills/`.
- Treido SSOT skills remain in `.codex/skills/` (`treido-*`).
