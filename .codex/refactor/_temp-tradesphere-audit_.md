# Folder: `temp-tradesphere-audit/`

Status: Not audited

## Why this folder exists (expected)

Looks like a one-off temporary audit folder. Likely deletable after extracting any stable docs into `docs/`.

## Audit checklist

- [ ] Confirm it is not used by build/test/runtime.
- [ ] Extract any valuable stable docs to `docs/`.
- [ ] Delete the folder once confirmed safe.
