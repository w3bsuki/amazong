# Folder: `.qoder/`

Status: Done — **DELETE** (duplicated skills pack)

## What it is

Tool-specific folder. In this repo it contains only `skills/`, which is a duplicated generic skill pack.

## Evidence

- Contents: `.qoder/skills/*` only (no unique config files observed).
- Skill pack is identical to `.agents/skills` (same 15 skills).

## Decision

Delete `.qoder/` entirely.
