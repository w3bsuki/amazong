# Folder: `.storybook/`

Status: Not audited

## Why this folder exists (expected)

Storybook config. Should be minimal and aligned with `storybook-static/` being generated only.

## Audit checklist

- [ ] Inventory configuration and scripts that reference it.
- [ ] Ensure Storybook build output is not committed.
- [ ] Remove dead addons/config and duplicated stories.
