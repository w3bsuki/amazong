# Folder: `.git/`

Status: Not audited (and generally should not be)

## Notes

This is Git metadata. We do **not** refactor it. The only relevant “audit” action is ensuring we do not accidentally commit or rely on generated outputs tracked by git.

## Audit checklist (safe)

- [ ] Confirm build outputs are not tracked (e.g. `.next/`, `node_modules/`, reports).
- [ ] Confirm `.gitignore` covers expected local artifacts.
