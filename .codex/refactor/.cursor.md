# Folder: `.cursor/`

Status: Done — **DELETED** (tool folder removed from repo)

## What it is

This is Cursor IDE config.

Current contents (before cleanup):
- `skills/` (a duplicated generic skill pack — identical to `.agents/skills`)
- `mcp.json` (Cursor MCP config; Supabase MCP setup)

## Evidence (duplication)

The `skills/` folder is the same 15-skill pack duplicated across many tool folders.
Sample diff shows no differences:
- `git diff --no-index .agents/skills/playwright/SKILL.md .cursor/skills/playwright/SKILL.md` (no output).

## Decision

- Deleted `.cursor/skills/` (duplicated pack).
- Deleted `.cursor/` entirely from git (tool-specific; not required for build/runtime).
- If we want a shared MCP setup doc, put it under `docs/` (stable docs SSOT), not repo-root tool folders.
