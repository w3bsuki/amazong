# Folder: `docs/`

Status: Not audited

## Why this folder exists (expected)

Stable documentation SSOT (per repo rails). Any stable guidance should eventually live here.

## Audit checklist

- [ ] Inventory docs and delete duplicates/obsolete tool-specific guides.
- [ ] Ensure there is one canonical index (`docs/00-INDEX.md`) and no drift.
- [ ] Move stable content out of repo-root tool folders into `docs/` if needed.
