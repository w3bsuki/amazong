# Folder: `.claude/`

Status: Done — **DELETED** (tool folder removed from repo)

## What it is

This is Claude tool configuration.

Current contents (before cleanup):
- `skills/` (a duplicated generic skill pack — identical to `.agents/skills`)
- `CLAUDE.md` (small instructions file)

## Evidence (duplication)

The `skills/` folder is the same 15-skill pack duplicated across many tool folders.
Sample diff shows no differences:
- `git diff --no-index .agents/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/SKILL.md .claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/SKILL.md` (no output).

Also: `CLAUDE.md` explicitly points Treido skills to `.codex/skills/` (so `.claude/skills` is not needed for Treido).

## Decision

- Deleted `.claude/skills/` (duplicated pack).
- Deleted `.claude/` entirely from git (it was tool-specific and not needed for build/runtime).
- Any stable guidance belongs in `docs/` (see `docs/11-SKILLS.md`).
