# Folder: `.codex/`

Status: Not audited

## Why this folder exists (expected)

Codex runtime state, tasks, decisions, and skills. This may be legit, but must be **clean + non-duplicative**.

## Audit checklist

- [ ] Inventory what is stable vs ephemeral (runtime logs, caches, etc).
- [ ] Ensure this does not duplicate `.agents/` or `docs/`.
- [ ] Confirm no secrets/PII are stored in tasks/logs.
- [ ] Decide which parts are committed vs local-only.

## Subagent prompt (copy/paste)

```text
AUDIT FOLDER: .codex/
Goal: identify what is truly needed and what is noise/duplication.
Output: Inventory + Keep/Move/Delete + risks.
```
