# Folder: `test/`

Status: Not audited

## Why this folder exists (expected)

Another test folder. Must be reconciled with `__tests__/` and `e2e/`.

## Audit checklist

- [ ] Identify which runner/framework uses this folder.
- [ ] Consolidate into one clear convention (unit/integration vs e2e).
- [ ] Delete dead tests/fixtures.
