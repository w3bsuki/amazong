# Folder: `.agents/`

Status: Done — **DELETED** (legacy generic skill pack)

## What it was

This folder held a generic “AI skills pack” (15 skills, ~203 files). The exact same pack was copied into many other tool folders, which is why the repo felt bloated.

## Evidence (duplication)

Duplicated copies exist under:
- `.agent/skills`
- `.claude/skills`
- `.cursor/skills`
- `.gemini/skills`
- `.kiro/skills`
- `.qoder/skills`
- `.qwen/skills`
- `.trae/skills`
- `.windsurf/skills`
- `.github/skills`

All of these contain the same 15 skill directories:
`accessibility-compliance`, `frontend-design`, `i18n-localization`, `mobile-ux-optimizer`, `nextjs-supabase-auth`, `playwright`, `pwa-expert`, `seo-audit`, `stripe-best-practices`, `supabase-postgres-best-practices`, `tailwind-v4-shadcn`, `typescript-advanced-types`, `ui-ux-pro-max`, `vercel-react-best-practices`, `web-design-guidelines`.

Sample diff shows no differences (byte-identical):
- `git diff --no-index .agents/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/SKILL.md .kiro/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/SKILL.md` (no output).

## Decision

Deleted `.agents/` from the repo.

Why:
- Treido’s SSOT skills are the `treido-*` fleet under `.codex/skills/` (see `docs/11-SKILLS.md`).
- The `.agents/` pack is not used by runtime/build/CI and had no in-repo references.
- Keeping it encourages multiple competing “skill systems” and adds noise during audits.

If someone needs these generic skills, install them **locally** (outside the repo), not duplicated in git.
