# Task Archive (NOT active queue)

This folder exists to keep `.codex/TASKS.md` **short and active-only**.

## Files

- Snapshot (pre-trim): `.codex/archive/tasks/2026-02-03_TASKS_snapshot.md`
- Backlog (open, not “Ready”): `.codex/archive/tasks/BACKLOG.md`
- Shipped log: `.codex/SHIPPED.md`

## Rule of thumb

- If it’s actively being worked this week → keep it in `.codex/TASKS.md`
- If it’s “eventually” / not ready / too many tasks → move it to `.codex/archive/tasks/BACKLOG.md`
- If it’s done → record in `.codex/SHIPPED.md`
