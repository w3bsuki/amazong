# 2026-02-02 — Dev Department / Agent System Request (Raw Prompt)

This file captures the raw prompt that kicked off the “dev department / agent system” redesign discussion, so we can iterate without losing context.

## Prompt (verbatim)

> i have an issue with my .codex agent skills. i think the agents there arent properly trained, they are mroe like generic agents. i also feel we need better agent techstack. claude is releasing dev team soon. what would a usual dev team require? frontend engineer, backend engineer, security/testing agents, what else? who is responsible for the repos clean state? our repo has bad rules. we need perfect agent skills for our subagents and perfect agents.md files in more than the root. basically all agents.md must be linked, example, root agents.md explains the agent skills, repo rules, techstack, etc, links to docs, example: styling -> /docs/styling.md, etc, links to other agetns.md ec, u get the idea. inside the /docs the agetns.md can be: read this doc for X: etc. u get the idea, also the agent skilsl must be better. we need to set up the perfect dev team, because we need to launc htis project toproducton, but were struggling. currently were working on the treido ui design agent in another terminal, we ned to figure out, frontend/backend agent specs, msut be way better. those agetns must know and understand how to work with netxjs / supabase etc. i also think maybe separating agetns by frontend/backend would need them to align the frontend too somehow, so if agent:frontend doesnt know about supabase backend, he might do dumb shit? no? i need you to take control of the dev department here, and become the orchestrator. i need you to deepthink, research the web on how dev teams work, what anthropic dev team is, openai etc. i need you to figure out the ai agent system we need to build for this ecommerce platform that will allow us to push to production. we want to: Launch to production, we need ai designer agent, coding agent, frontend/backend or one, we need agent that cleans up codebase and keeps it tidy, basically we need to identify what this codebase and project has and needs, and dcreate those agents so they are specialists in their own field. when we get to cleaning up codebase, i dont wanna have to prompt u and u figuring out what tools to use, what to do, fetching docs, losing context. we want ot launch teh cleanup agent which has idk if thats the word a mermaid project structur eor msth that can see the project structure and understands nextjs project structure with our techstack and can identify stuff, etc. i dont evne know if we need such agent. i just want to have a trained dev team on this. for example, we can have an agent that is responsible for plans, monetization, poaymetns etc. so whe nwe launch, if i wanna update the plans, instead of having u fethc all code etc, i can prompt you to orchestrate our plans/billing agent to inspect all plans etc and work on them for exaple. it will know what folder to use, etc. basically we need to set up the perfect dev team, which me and u can orchestrate and use as subagents whe nwe weork. if those agents are pretrained, and understadn everything, then we will save context and they will work much better and more efficient. we need an agent that is responsible for the docs for example. we have so many docs. whe nwe write docs/guides etc, we need an agent responsible for those, so he works in the same wfolder and we dont scatter docs. docs are really important because with them we can keep perfect context management and project management and work in peace. for example, i wanna implement a feature: We open the docs, see all features we want, we have checkmarks for implemented and non implemented have no checkmark, i see feature 50 is next inm line and i tell you: Please use our subagents and implement feature 50 from features.md, for example. u get me? we need up to 5-10 single source of truth docs, perfect agent system that references the docs, agents that understadn and are trianed for their field. example: having an agent that understadns nextjs 16 and is trained on these patterns, for example our frontend agents wants to work on something, he can always work with nextjs16 specialist agent or that agent can always give "advice" idk how to achieve this. is this too much? are agent skills necessary or just using agents.md for folders? I have no clue, anthropic and openai and users are claiming agetns.md and skill agents can improve workflow a lot. basically on every call if we pretrain those agents we will save context from them fetching docs, checkin best practices,etc. but we need to keep them updated all the time. so maybe we can TRAIN an AGENT that UNDERSTANDS oru AGETN system? exampole: Orchestrtor agent-> in its agent.md we write down all agents, theri features, what they excel at. after 1 month we ask the orchestrator to check agetn1, fetch the web to see if any techstack updates are done, for example if agent 1 is nextjs agent, orchestrator fetches docs and latest best practices, achecks agents1 skill.md, updates it, this agent can be ran weekly, to verify all agents are in check. lets plan the perfect agent systme, that works with our codebase, please? deepthink this, planmode, u can use subagetns to research this topic, create full plan, must be super extensive and logical, must allow us to have the best developer system. this is a life saving project, lterally. treat it with respect and become the savior of this platform. we need to launch to production and have the best ecommerce ebay competitor, with the greatest ui,ux and platform features. we hjave existing docs, we need to consolidate verything. all .md files must be inside /docs, or whatever folder. our agetns must work with those. maybe in my opinion, we research the matter, we create full plans, and we create for example the masterplan.md for the agent that trains agents? then me and u train the "Agent orchestrator" agent, so we can iterate and spend time on each agent. we can juist create the folder and docs structure. can we keep /docs inside .codex, or insied/ docs? maybe we can have /docs specific for our agents inside .codex, and project /docs inside root folder, but im not sure if thats okay, since these agents will be trained for THIS project. we must plan this, maybe focus on creating the main agent first, the agent orchestrator, because in his skill.md we can add all agents we need, or we can actually add all agents we need inside the .md masterplan, inside the /orchestrator agent, we can crete masterplan.md, which will have all agent dev team we need, current agents refactor or create new ones, and we need to plan the docs structure. so the orchestrator agent can build our docs/senior dev first, who will be responsible for docs structure, project structure,etc? what dou think? the senior dev can understand folders,yaml,atomic shit, shadcn,nextjs,typescript,tailwincsds structure. he doesnt need to understand how to write the code, he needs to understand how to organize folders and structures. lets deepthink and create the foundation and master .md docs for this entire prompt, we can create the master docs for the orchestrator agent, and the senior dev agent, start the foundation/create the templates for other agents, and 1 by 1 will work on them. example: we create the foundation, and each task/prompt we will do only 1 agent, to ensure that agent is perfectly coded and has perfect skil.md, settings,etc. here is the doc: https://skills.sh/ https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview https://developers.openai.com/codex/skills/ maybe, we can build the "Agent builder" agent first, which will be trained on all skills.sh, anthropic/open ai official docs for agent skills, so that agent can then set up the perfect agent? however, we need t his prompt, so add this prompt to an .md file, create new folder, and deepthink how should we approach this. we need this whole picture in .md file, and we ned to approach it methodically. i think it makes most sense to crete the agent builder skill, which will be trained on all these official docs. skills.sh has a lot of docs available there, we can use the existing skilsl and tailor them and make them better to our codebase. u can see how easy skills.md is to creat with this example: https://skills.sh/anthropics/skills/frontend-design deepthink and plan this. crete /codex folder and work in there for the entire setup, when we create it, we will move files to .codex merge/consolidate etc. for now we build in /codex
