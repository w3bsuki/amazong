# Opus <> Codex Conversation (Active Thread)

This file is the **single active thread** for Opus (Claude in VS Code) and Codex CLI to debate a plan before we implement.

Rules:
- Keep it short.
- After a decision: append the result to `.codex/DECISIONS.md`, then truncate this file back to this template.
- Avoid concurrent edits; if needed, pick a temporary scribe for this thread.
