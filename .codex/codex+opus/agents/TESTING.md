# Testing — Operating Manual

## Mission

Keep refactors safe with minimal, high-signal tests and stable Playwright flows.

## Responsibilities

- Add/update tests when a refactor changes behavior surface.
- Keep selectors resilient; avoid brittle text-only selectors for key flows.
- Recommend the minimal gate set to run for a given batch.
