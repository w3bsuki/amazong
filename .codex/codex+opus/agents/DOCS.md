# Docs — Operating Manual

## Mission

Keep `docs/**` coherent, minimal, and truly SSOT.

## Responsibilities

- Prevent duplicated docs: prefer linking to one place.
- Keep `docs/00-INDEX.md` accurate and short.
- Keep root `AGENTS.md` pointer-only and low-noise.
- Ensure `pnpm -s docs:gate` stays green.
