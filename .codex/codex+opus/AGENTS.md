# AGENTS.md — Codex+Opus Lab (Agent System Iteration)

This folder is a **sandbox** for iterating on Treido’s **docs system + agent/skill architecture**.

## Rules

- **Do not treat this folder as product SSOT.** Stable docs belong in `docs/**`.
- Use this lab to produce **decision-complete** proposals, then implement in small batches elsewhere.
- Never delete/overwrite source proposals; iterate by **adding** and referencing (append-only mindset).

## Start Here

1) `CONTEXT.md` — current consolidated “best of both worlds” decision
2) `agents/` — role playbooks (how each agent operates)
3) `CHAT.md` — 3-round structured iteration history
4) `references/REFERENCES.md` — external inspirations + internal pointers

## Source Material

- Opus proposal (kept intact): `.codex/proposals/2026-02-03_opus_docs_skills_iteration.md`
- Treido entrypoint: `docs/AGENTS.md`
- Shipping loop: `docs/WORKFLOW.md`
- Skill inventory: `docs/11-SKILLS.md`
- Refactor orchestration: `.codex/refactor/ORCHESTRATION.md`

## How we iterate (3 rounds)

1) **Round 1 — Theses:** Opus proposes; Codex proposes
2) **Round 2 — Rebuttal:** each critiques the other
3) **Round 3 — Synthesis:** consolidate into one decision + action items

Write the dialogue to `CHAT.md`, then update `CONTEXT.md` with the final decision and actionable next steps.
