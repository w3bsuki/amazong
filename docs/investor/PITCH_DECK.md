## Slide 2: The Problem

### Bulgaria's E-commerce is Broken

| The Corporate Giant | The Wild West |
|:--------------------|:--------------|
| **eMag** | **OLX / Facebook Marketplace** |
| ✓ Trusted | ✓ Free |
| ✓ Secure payments | ✓ Easy to list |
| ✗ 15%+ fees crush small sellers | ✗ High fraud risk |
| ✗ Dominated by big brands | ✗ No payment protection |
| ✗ Cold, impersonal | ✗ Chaotic, unprofessional |

> **The Gap:** There is no platform that is **trusted, affordable, AND community-driven.**

## Slide 4: Market Opportunity

### A €2.34 Billion Market, Growing Fast

| Metric | Value |

| **YoY Growth** | 15-20% |
| **Projected 2027** | €3.1 Billion |
| **Online Share of Retail** | 5-10% (room to grow) |

### Our Target: Underserved Segments

*   **Small Businesses:** Squeezed by eMag's 15%+ fees
*   **Individual Sellers:** Burned by OLX scams
*   **Eco-Conscious Buyers:** No platform promotes second-hand + charity

**SAM (Serviceable Available Market):** €450 Million  
**Year 3 Target:** €70-117M GMV (3-5% market share)

## Slide 6: Competitive Advantage

### Why Competitors Can't Copy Us

| Moat | Our Advantage | Why It's Defensible |
|:-----|:--------------|:--------------------|
| **Karma Commerce** | Charity integration is core, not an add-on | Requires partnerships, brand DNA |
| **"Nano Banana" Brand** | Distinctive, entertaining voice | Brand is hard to replicate |
| **Local Focus** | Deep understanding of Bulgarian market | eMag is regional; OLX is generic |
| **Low Fees** | 5-10% vs. 15%+ | Sustainable due to lean ops |

## Slide 12: Why Now?

### Timing is Everything

1.  **E-commerce Acceleration:** COVID permanently shifted shopping online. Bulgaria catching up to EU averages.
2.  **Generational Shift:** Gen Z demands authenticity, sustainability, and entertainment in shopping.
3.  **AI Content Revolution:** We can create Super Bowl-quality ads for €0 using AI tools (Veo, Midjourney, ElevenLabs).
4.  **Competitor Stagnation:** eMag focused on logistics, ignoring community. OLX stuck in classifieds model.

## Slide 13: Vision

### Building the "Bulgarian Amazon with a Soul"

> "In 5 years, when Bulgarians think of online shopping, we want them to think of Amazong—not because we're the biggest, but because we're the most trusted, the most fun, and the most impactful."
