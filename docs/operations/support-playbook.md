I'm sorry your boost doesn't appear to be active.

- Status: [STATUS]

[IF NOT APPLIED]:
I've manually applied the boost to your listing "[LISTING]". It should be active now — please check and confirm.

[IF ALREADY APPLIED]:
The boost is active on your listing. Boosts improve your visibility but don't guarantee a specific position. You can track performance in your listing analytics.

Let me know if you need anything else!

Best regards,
[YOUR NAME]
```

Best regards,

Hi [NAME],

Thank you for reaching out about a refund.

Unfortunately, I'm not able to process a refund in this case because:
[REASON - e.g., "the boost was already activated and used"]

According to our Terms of Service, paid promotions that have been activated are non-refundable.

I understand this is frustrating. If you experienced a technical issue, please let me know the details and I'll see what I can do to help.

Best regards,
[YOUR NAME]
```
