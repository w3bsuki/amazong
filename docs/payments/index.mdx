# Payments Overview

Treido launches with **on-platform payments** (no COD) and a clear **Buyer Protection** fee.

## What we use

- **Stripe** for card payments
- **Stripe Connect (Express)** for seller payouts
- **Separate Charges and Transfers** for escrow-like control of payouts

## Why Buyer Protection exists

The Buyer Protection fee pays for:

- Payment processing costs
- Escrow-style release (hold until delivery confirmed)
- Support and dispute handling
- Fraud loss buffer and operational tooling
