# Escrow & Order Lifecycle

## High-level flow

1. Buyer pays via Stripe (platform account)
2. Order is created in DB (status `paid`)
3. Seller ships (tracking captured)
4. Delivery is confirmed (carrier or buyer confirmation)
5. Platform transfers funds to seller (minus any business seller fee)

## Minimal statuses

- `pending_payment`
- `paid`
- `shipped`
- `delivered`
- `completed`
- `disputed`
- `cancelled`
- `refunded`

## Release rules (escrow-style)

- No transfer to seller until:
  - buyer confirms receipt, or
  - auto-confirm window passes, and
  - no open dispute exists
