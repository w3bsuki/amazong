# Audits (Research)

This folder contains **research docs** (not policy) used to improve the product.

## Structure

- `docs/audit/competitive/` — competitor analysis (OLX/Bazar/industry patterns)
- `docs/audit/product/` — audits of Treido itself (desktop/mobile UX, improvement plans)
- `docs/audit-screenshots/` — supporting screenshots referenced by audits

## How to use audits

- Use audits to create scoped tasks in `TODO.md`.
- Do not treat audit filenames/dates as canonical product requirements.
