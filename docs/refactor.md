# Refactor Program — Where to Look

> **Purpose:** Keep the refactor program discoverable without turning `/docs` into a high-churn workspace.

---

## TL;DR

- **Active refactor workspace (runtime):** `.codex/refactor/`
- **Active task queue:** `.codex/TASKS.md`
- **Historical snapshots:** use VCS history (archive docs were removed from runtime SSOT)

---

## How to Use

1) Read `docs/WORKFLOW.md` (gates + small-batch loop).
2) Use `.codex/refactor/README.md` to navigate the active refactor workspace.
3) Track execution in `.codex/TASKS.md` (keep it active-only).
