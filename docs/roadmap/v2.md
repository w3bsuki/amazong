# V2 Launch (Treido.eu) — Card Payments + Marketplace Payouts

**Last updated:** 2026-01-14

V2 introduces on-platform card payments and seller payouts.

## Goal

Enable optional on-platform payments that users actually choose because they get:

- convenience (pay by card)
- trust (clear protection process)
- reliable seller payouts

## In Scope (V2)

- Card payments for goods on-platform
- Seller payouts via Stripe Connect (Express)
- Order lifecycle: paid → fulfilled → completed
- Refunds and support workflows (minimum viable)

## Out of Scope (V2, unless explicitly added)

- Full escrow arbitration system
- Complex shipping carrier integrations (beyond MVP)
- Multi-currency settlement (unless required)

## Monetization (V2)

V2 monetization depends on the chosen model:

- Seller fee (final value fee) and/or buyer protection fee
- Subscriptions that reduce fees and unlock business tooling

See `docs/business/model.md` and `docs/business/plans.md`.

## Definition of Done (V2)

- Buyer pays by card → seller receives payout (minus fees) → refunds work
- Disputes have a documented and runnable process (even if manual)

## Prerequisites (hard gates)

- Stripe Connect Express onboarding works in production
- Payout status is tracked and visible to sellers/admin
- Refunds and webhook reliability are verified
- Terms/policy pages cover payments + refunds (legal review)

## Milestones (suggested)

- **V2.0 (payments MVP):** card payments + payouts + basic refunds
- **V2.1 (trust):** buyer protection UX, reporting/moderation, stronger seller verification

## Key risks (V2)

- Payout compliance/ops risk without Stripe Connect
- Refund/dispute flows creating support load without tooling
- Users bypassing checkout via chat if the checkout experience isn’t clearly better
