# Roadmap (Treido.eu)

**Last updated:** 2026-01-14

This roadmap is organized by **phases**. Each phase is a contract:

- what is in-scope
- what is explicitly out-of-scope
- what “done” means

The goal is to ship Treido.eu safely and avoid scope creep.

## Phases

- `docs/roadmap/v1.md` — V1 launch (classifieds-first + boosts)
- `docs/roadmap/v2.md` — V2 launch (card payments + seller payouts)
- `docs/roadmap/v3.md` — V3 launch (scale & expansion)

## Market Research

- `docs/research/bulgarian-market-2026.md` — Bulgarian marketplace competitive analysis

## How to use this roadmap

- Treat phase docs as **product/engineering alignment**, not a task tracker.
- Track the “what we’re doing next” work in `TODO.md`.
- When scope changes, update the relevant phase doc first.

## Gates (applies to every phase)

- Follow `docs/PRODUCTION.md` for launch gates and verification.
- Keep V1 and V2 separated by risk: payouts/refunds/disputes are a different product.

## Metrics (what success means)

Define success per phase:

- **V1:** listings created, messages sent, repeat visits, boost attach rate
- **V2:** checkout adoption rate, successful payouts, refund rate, dispute rate, GMV
- **V3:** mobile app users, regional expansion, AI feature adoption, shipping integration usage
