## Key Risks (V3)

1. **Expansion too fast** — Spreading resources thin across markets
2. **Mobile development cost** — Native apps are expensive to maintain
3. **AI accuracy** — False positives in fraud detection hurt trust
4. **Shipping complexity** — Carrier integrations are maintenance-heavy
5. **Competition response** — OLX/Bazar may react aggressively

## Risk Mitigation

- **Expansion:** One country at a time, prove PMF before next
- **Mobile:** Start with PWA improvements, native only if justified by data
- **AI:** Human review for high-confidence flags, conservative thresholds
- **Shipping:** Partner with aggregator (Shipy.pro?) before direct integrations
- **Competition:** Focus on UX and trust, not just price
