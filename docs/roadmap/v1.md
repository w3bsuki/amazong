# V1 Launch (Treido.eu) — Classifieds-First + Boosts

**Last updated:** 2026-01-14

V1 matches the OLX.bg / Bazar.bg workflow: listings + chat. Payment and shipping are arranged between buyer and seller.

## Goal

Ship the simplest possible product that:

- helps buyers discover listings fast
- helps buyers contact sellers fast
- earns money via visibility upgrades (boosts)

## In Scope (V1)

- Listings: create, edit, browse, search, categories
- Trust: seller profiles, basic seller stats, verification badges (where ready)
- Messaging: buyer ↔ seller chat
- Monetization: paid promotions (boosts / featured placements)

## Product constraints (V1)

- Treat “buy” as “contact”: the primary CTA is messaging.
- Shipping/payment happens outside Treido in V1.
- Promotions must be simple and obvious (OLX mental model).

## Out of Scope (V1)

- Card payments for goods
- Marketplace payouts (Stripe Connect)
- Commission on sales (no on-platform checkout)
- Escrow / buyer protection

## Monetization (V1)

- Boost pricing and catalog lives in `docs/business/model.md`.

## Definition of Done (V1)

- Users can reliably: discover listings → message seller → complete off-platform transaction
- Boost purchase works end-to-end (no payout risk)

## Milestones (suggested)

- **V1.0 (public launch):** search + listing + chat + boosts, stable and fast
- **V1.1 (post-launch):** trust signals + moderation + UX density improvements (Bazar/OLX learnings)

## Key risks (V1)

- Spam listings without strong rate limits/moderation
- Sellers bypassing boosts because boosts don’t visibly improve results
- Confusing UI if checkout/cart is visible but not “real” for V1
