# Docs (Start Here)

This repo keeps a small set of canonical docs that agents and humans should rely on.

Start here:
- Agent entrypoint: `agents.md`
- Rules + “what to read”: `RULES.md`

Canonical docs under `docs/`:
- `docs/ENGINEERING.md` — boundaries, caching, Supabase usage
- `docs/DESIGN.md` — design system + Tailwind/shadcn implementation rules
- `docs/FEATURES.md` — routes/actions/DB/tests map
- `docs/FRONTEND.md` — frontend patterns + i18n rules
- `docs/BACKEND.md` — Supabase/Stripe/backend patterns
- `docs/TESTING.md` — gates + test running
- `docs/PRODUCTION.md` — go-live checklist
- `docs/PRODUCT.md` — scope + roadmap

If something isn’t covered by the files above, update the relevant canonical doc instead of creating new, competing docs.
