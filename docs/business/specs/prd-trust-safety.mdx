# PRD: Trust & Safety (V1)

## Objective

Ship the minimum trust & safety layer required for a real-money marketplace launch.

## Why this matters

- Trust failures directly create chargebacks, disputes, refunds, and brand damage.
- Payment providers punish marketplaces with high dispute/chargeback rates.

## In scope (V1)

### 1) Reports & blocks

- buyers can report sellers/listings
- users can block other users
- moderation queue for admins (triage → action)

### 2) Disputes and evidence

- standard dispute reasons (INR, damaged, not as described, counterfeit, harassment)
- evidence uploads (photos, tracking references)
- strict state machine: disputed blocks payout release

### 3) Verification and limits

- phone verification (anti-spam)
- seller limits for new sellers (listing caps, price caps)
- escalation path to stronger verification (Stripe Connect onboarding + platform checks)

### 4) Admin tooling (minimum viable)

- admin docs, tasks, notes for operational playbooks
- ability to document decisions and policies internally
- audit-friendly history (who did what, when)

## Out of scope (explicit)

- automated ML fraud scoring (later)
- complex arbitration process (keep V1 predictable)

## Requirements

- Dispute types and default outcomes documented: see [Dispute Resolution Matrix](/business/ops/dispute-resolution-matrix)
- Refund/chargeback playbook documented: see [Payments Ops Runbook](/payments/ops-runbook)
- “Stop-the-line” rules: payout release bugs are SEV-0 incidents

## Acceptance criteria

- Dispute can be opened with a reason + evidence.
- When a dispute exists, payout release is blocked.
- Admins can resolve a dispute with a documented outcome.
- Reports can be triaged and result in enforceable actions.
