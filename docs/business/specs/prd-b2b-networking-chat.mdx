# PRD: B2B Networking (Future)

This is a **future** module. It should not compromise V1 safety, moderation capacity, or payments stability.

## 1) Why consider this

Treido can differentiate by supporting not only C2C listings, but also **verified B2B relationships**:

- distributors sourcing inventory
- small businesses finding suppliers
- repeat purchasing and partnership conversations

## 2) Product principles

- **Verified-only**: only verified business accounts can access B2B networking.
- **Private by default**: no public posting; start with 1:1 chat and introductions.
- **Strong anti-spam**: messaging limits, reporting, and enforcement.
- **No mixing with consumer chat**: separate UI space + permissions.

## 3) Scope (phase options)

### Phase A: “Business inbox”

- Verified business-to-business 1:1 chat
- Optional “Request intro” flow instead of cold DM
- Rate limits + reporting

### Phase B: “Business directory”

- Discoverable business profiles (opt-in)
- Filters (category, location, MOQ, shipping)
- Contact request workflow

### Phase C: “Groups”

- Private groups per category/industry
- Heavy moderation requirements (likely not worth it early)

## 4) Risks & mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Spam/outreach abuse | High | verification gate + rate limits + bans |
| Moderation burden | High | keep private-only, delay groups |
| Data protection | Medium | retention policy + access controls |
| Dilution of V1 focus | High | ship only after payments + disputes are stable |

## 5) Launch gates (if/when built)

- business verification flow is reliable (KYB)
- enforcement tooling exists (admin review, bans, audits)
- retention policy for messages is defined

## 6) Decision

Default: **defer** until after V1 is stable and trust systems are proven.
