# PRD: Monetization Model

## Objective

Build a monetization model that is:

- low-fee and transparent (reduces off-platform leakage)
- strong enough to fund trust & safety operations
- configurable (plan-driven), not hard-coded

## Core model

- Buyer pays Buyer Protection fee (percent + fixed, capped).
- Business sellers pay a small seller fee.
- Subscriptions reduce fees and unlock tooling.

## Requirements

- Fee calculation is deterministic and stored per order at purchase time.
- Fees are visible to buyers before payment.
- Webhooks are the source of truth for payment state.
- Support tooling exists for refunds and disputes.

## Acceptance criteria

- Given a plan + item price, the checkout UI and DB calculation match.
- Cap is enforced.
- Fee changes do not retroactively alter existing orders.

## Source of truth
