# Plans & Pricing

Plans are split by account type:

- **Personal** users live under `/account`
- **Business** users can unlock `/dashboard` with a paid plan

Canonical plan prices are stored in `subscription_plans` in **EUR**. UI can display **BGN** (with conversion) later.

## Personal plans

|------|---------|-----------------|-----------|------------------|
| Free | €0 | 30 | 0% | 4% + €0.50 (cap €15) |

## Business plans

| Plan | Monthly | Active listings | Seller fee | Buyer protection |

Notes:

- Subscriptions are most valuable when they reduce buyer fees + improve sell-through rate.
- Any "team seats" / "API access" must be implemented before being marketed.

## Boosts

- Paid plans include **monthly boost credits** (24h boosts).
- One-time paid boosts are available as add-ons (24h / 7d / 30d).
