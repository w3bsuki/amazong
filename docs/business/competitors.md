## Direct Competitors (Bulgaria)

### OLX Bulgaria (olx.bg)

**What they are:** Classifieds platform. The dominant marketplace in BG.

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Strength** | Massive user base, brand recognition, established trust |
| **Weakness** | No integrated payments (cash/bank transfer only), dated UX, scam-prone |
| **Listings model** | Limited free listings per subcategory (NOT unlimited). Since April 2025, some categories have annual limits (1 free listing per subcategory/year for business users). Private users get slightly more generous limits but still capped. Extra listings sold as paid packages. |
| **Monetization** | Paid listing packages (when free limit exhausted), promoted/VIP listings, renewal fees. No transaction fees (no payments system). As of Jan 2026, all platform payments in EUR. |
| **Mobile** | App exists but feels like a web wrapper |
| **Trust** | Low — buyers and sellers meet in person or risk bank transfers |

**Treido advantage:** Secure card payments, modern UX, order tracking, seller dashboards. OLX's own listing limits create frustration — sellers who hit the cap may look for alternatives.
**Treido risk:** OLX has the traffic. Users may not switch for payments alone.

### Bazar.bg

**What they are:** Second-largest Bulgarian classifieds. Still active, used across many categories.

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Strength** | Established, free listings (seemingly more generous than OLX), covers all categories (jobs, real estate, cars, electronics, pets, etc.) |
| **Weakness** | Very dated UI/UX, no integrated payments, no checkout, VIP/promo options feel old-school |
| **Monetization** | VIP listing packages, promoted listings ("Промо опции"), paid renewal/boost. No transaction fees. |
| **Mobile** | Functional but not modern |

**Treido advantage:** Modern UX, integrated payments, order tracking, business dashboard.
**Treido risk:** Bazar users are habitual — switching requires a clear reason.

### Facebook Marketplace / Groups

**What they are:** Peer-to-peer selling via Facebook.

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Strength** | Massive reach, social proof (real profiles), zero friction to list |
| **Weakness** | No checkout, no order tracking, scams, no seller tools |
| **Monetization** | None for BG (Facebook Checkout not available) |

**Treido advantage:** Real checkout, order tracking, seller dashboard, dedicated experience.
**Treido risk:** Facebook has the users. Convenience of "post and sell" is hard to beat.

## Indirect Competitors (EU)

### Vinted

**What they are:** EU fashion/secondhand marketplace. Massive in Western EU.

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Strength** | Strong brand, buyer protection, mobile-first, free listings |
| **Weakness** | Fashion/clothing only, not general marketplace |
| **Monetization** | 5% buyer protection fee + €0.70 per transaction |
| **Mobile** | Excellent native apps |
| **Trust** | High — integrated payments + buyer protection |

**Relevance:** Vinted proves EU users will pay for trust + integrated payments. But they don't handle electronics, furniture, business sellers.

### Etsy

**What they are:** Handmade/vintage/craft marketplace. Global.

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Monetization** | €0.18/listing + 6.5% transaction + 3% payment processing |
| **Relevance** | Shows that marketplace fees work when platform provides value |

### Shopify

**What they are:** Not a marketplace. Standalone store builder.

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Price** | €36/month basic + 2% transaction fee |
| **Relevance** | Our "Business" tier competes with Shopify for small sellers who want an online store but not the Shopify complexity/price |

## Key Insight

**Nobody in Bulgaria does general marketplace + integrated card payments.** OLX dominates but refuses to add payments. Vinted has payments but only does fashion. Facebook has reach but no checkout. 

Treido's V1 thesis: **If we build a general marketplace with Stripe payments and premium UX, we capture the gap.**

The risk: **The gap exists because it's hard to build a two-sided marketplace from zero.** Supply (sellers) and demand (buyers) must grow together.
