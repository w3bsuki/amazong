## Positioning

**"Sell anything. Get paid securely."**

- No cash on delivery — card payments only
- Buyer Protection on every transaction
- Verified sellers + business accounts
- Modern, mobile-first UX

**What we're NOT:** Another OLX (no payments, no trust). Another Vinted (fashion-only). Another Shopify (we're a marketplace, not a standalone store builder).

## Launch Phases

### Phase 0: Pre-Launch (Current)

**Goal:** Product ready, no public users.

- [ ] V1 launch criteria met (see `docs/PRD.md`)
- [ ] 4 launch blockers resolved (Stripe idempotency, refund flow, env separation, password protection)
- [ ] Broken areas fixed (search, sell flow, account settings)
- [ ] Test listings seeded with real-looking data
- [ ] Terms of Service + Privacy Policy published
- [ ] Support playbooks written (refunds, disputes, fraud)

### Phase 1: Supply Seeding (T-30 → T-7)

**Goal:** Build initial inventory before opening to buyers.

- Recruit 10–20 trusted early sellers (friends, family, local community)
- Onboard 3–5 verified businesses (density in wedge categories)
- Pick **3–5 wedge categories** to win first — **[DECISION NEEDED]**
- Target: 50+ quality listings before any buyer sees the platform

### Phase 2: Closed Beta (T-7 → T+14)

**Goal:** Validate core flows with real users. Fix what breaks.

- **Size:** 20–50 users (direct invite)
- **Duration:** 2–4 weeks
- **Focus:** Does buy/sell/pay/ship work end-to-end?
- **Success criteria:**
  - 10+ real transactions completed
  - Payout works end-to-end
  - No critical bugs (payments, auth, data loss)
  - Feedback collected (verbal, NPS, or form)

### Phase 3: Open Beta (T+14 → T+90)

**Goal:** Grow organically. Test acquisition channels.

- **Size:** 200–1,000 users
- **Channels:** Social media, Facebook groups, word of mouth, local SEO
- **Success criteria:**
  - 100+ active listings
  - 50+ transactions
  - Repeat buyers/sellers
  - First paying subscribers (Plus or Pro)

### Phase 4: Public Launch

**Goal:** Treido is live for Bulgaria. Growth mode.

- Full marketing push
- Bulgarian tech press coverage
- Influencer partnerships (Instagram/TikTok sellers)
- SEO for Bulgarian marketplace keywords
- Referral program (if built)

### Phase 5: Expansion (V2+)

- Romania (RON currency, Romanian language)
- Greece (Greek language)
- Multi-country Stripe Connect
- Localized marketing per market

## Messaging

| Audience | Pain Point | Message |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Casual sellers | Buyers flake, no payments | "List → Sell → Get paid to your card" |
| Small businesses | Can't afford Shopify | "Your online store, no dev needed" |
| Buyers | Scams, no protection | "Pay with card. Real sellers. Real tracking." |

---

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Empty marketplace (no listings) | Seed listings, incentivize first sellers, personal outreach |
| No buyers (low traffic) | SEO, social, ads. Focus BG local first. |
| OLX/Bazar copy our model | Move fast, UX quality moat, card payments hard to retrofit |
| Payment trust issues | Stripe branding, buyer protection messaging, reviews |
| Off-platform leakage | Keep fees low (0% seller), provide real value (escrow, tracking) |

## Open Questions

| ID | Question | Status |
|----|----------|--------|
| GTM-001 | Which 3–5 wedge categories? | Undecided |
