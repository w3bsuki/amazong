# Monetization Model

How Treido earns revenue while keeping fees low enough to prevent off-platform leakage.

## Principles (non-negotiable)

- **Personal sellers keep 100% of item price** (0% seller fee)
- Buyers pay a clear **Buyer Protection** fee for escrow + support + dispute handling
- Businesses pay a **small seller fee** (they expect costs, want invoices, and need tooling)
- **Subscriptions reduce fees** and unlock tools (especially for businesses)

## Core fee model (Vinted-style hybrid)

Buyer Protection fee formula (per order):

```
buyer_fee = min(
  item_price * buyer_protection_percent + buyer_protection_fixed,
  buyer_protection_cap
)
```

Seller fee (business only):

```
seller_fee = item_price * seller_fee_percent
```

These values are **plan-driven** in `subscription_plans` (**locked for v1**):

| Account | Plan | Seller fee | Buyer protection |
|--------:|------|------------|------------------|
| Personal | Free | 0% | 4% + €0.50 (cap €15) |
| Personal | Plus | 0% | 3.5% + €0.40 (cap €14) |
| Personal | Pro | 0% | 3% + €0.30 (cap €12) |
| Business | Free | 1.5% | 3% + €0.35 (cap €12) |
| Business | Pro | 1% | 2.5% + €0.25 (cap €10) |
| Business | Enterprise | 0.5% | 2% + €0.20 (cap €8) |

Example: €50 item (Personal Free seller)

- Buyer pays: `€50 + (4% × €50) + €0.50 = €52.50`
- Seller receives: `€50.00` (0% seller fee)
- Platform collects: `€2.50` (covers Stripe processing + support + fraud loss buffer)

## Secondary revenue

### Subscriptions

- Personal: mainly lower buyer fees + seller tools (more listings, boosts, visibility)
- Business: lower fees + `/dashboard` tooling + invoicing/ops support

### Promotions / boosts
Optional add-ons to increase visibility (best as a-la-carte, not required for core revenue).

See: [Boosts & Promotions](/business/boosts)

## Limits & guardrails

Monetization only works if outcomes are predictable (fees, refunds, disputes) and if boosts can’t be abused to spam feeds.

See: [Limits & Guardrails](/business/guardrails)

## Why this works (investor-friendly explanation)

- **Low seller friction** (personal sellers keep 100% → less off-platform leakage)
- **Transparent buyer value** (protection fee pays for trust, refunds, and dispute process)
- **Businesses pay** for tooling and predictable operations
- **Unit economics** scale with GMV while subscriptions stabilize revenue
