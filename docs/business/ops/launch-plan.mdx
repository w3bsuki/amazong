# Launch Plan

## Objective

Ship a safe MVP to production, validate product-market fit, then iterate fast.

## Owners (suggested)

- Product: scope, prioritization, comms
- Engineering: payments stability, performance, reliability
- Ops/Support: playbooks, macros, dispute workflows
- Trust & Safety: moderation rules + enforcement
- Legal/Compliance: policies reviewed and signed off (drafts → publishable)

## Pre-launch (T-30 → T-7)

- Finalize policies (returns/refunds, prohibited items, KYC)
- Verify Stripe Connect onboarding and webhooks (idempotency end-to-end)
- Confirm fee configuration (Buyer Protection + business seller fee)
- Create support macros and dispute workflows (SLA + evidence checklist)
- Seed initial supply (trusted sellers, partnerships)
- Set up monitoring: payments, webhooks, errors, performance, dispute volume

## Launch week (T-7 → T+7)

- Gradual rollout (invite / waitlist if needed)
- Daily monitoring:
  - checkout success rate
  - webhook failures / retries
  - payout onboarding failures
  - disputes and refunds
  - fraud signals, reports, bans
  - crash rate and P95 performance
- Rapid bugfixing with strict rollback rules (no risky refactors)

## Post-launch (T+7 → T+30)

- Improve onboarding conversion (sell vs buy CTA)
- Add missing features discovered in real usage
- Start growth loops (referrals, SEO, partnerships)
- Start reputation iteration (better seller signals, badges milestones)
