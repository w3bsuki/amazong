# Unit Economics (Per Order)

## Goal

Prove the model can fund:

- Stripe processing costs
- support + dispute handling
- fraud loss buffer
- product development and growth

…while keeping fees low enough to avoid off-platform leakage.

## Fee model (plan-driven)

Buyer fee:

```
buyer_fee = min(
  item_price * buyer_protection_percent + buyer_protection_fixed,
  buyer_protection_cap
)
```

Business seller fee:

```
seller_fee = item_price * seller_fee_percent
```

## Example (Personal Free, €50 item)

- Buyer fee: `min(€50×4% + €0.50, €15) = €2.50`
- Buyer total: `€52.50`
- Seller receives: `€50.00`
- Platform gross revenue (before Stripe/support): `€2.50`

## Cost buckets to track

- Stripe processing (variable + fixed)
- refunds/chargebacks (loss rate)
- support cost per dispute (time + tooling)
- fraud prevention costs (verification, monitoring)

## Contribution margin (simple model)

```
contribution = buyer_fee + seller_fee - stripe_cost - refunds_loss - support_allocation
```

## Sensitivities to monitor

- low-price orders are dominated by fixed Stripe fees → cap/fixed fee matters
- fraud spikes can wipe margin → early risk controls are critical
- support load scales with disputes, not GMV → keep dispute rate low

## Implementation requirements

- Store fee components per order at purchase time (no retroactive changes).
- Keep plan config in DB (`subscription_plans`) and cache per seller when needed.
