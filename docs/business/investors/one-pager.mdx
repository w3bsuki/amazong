# One-Pager

## Mission

Build the most trusted, modern marketplace in our region—where buying and selling feels safe enough for real money, not just chats.

## Problem

Classifieds-style marketplaces are efficient at supply, but:

- transactions move off-platform (no visibility, no safety guarantees)
- fraud is common (COD scams, counterfeit goods, “item not as described”)
- trust is hard to establish between strangers

## Solution

Treido is a **C2C/B2B marketplace** with:

- on-platform payments (Stripe)
- Buyer Protection + support
- escrow-style payout release after delivery confirmation
- transparent fees that are low enough to avoid off-platform leakage

## Target customers (initial)

- C2C sellers who want higher sell-through due to trust
- buyers who want protection and refunds when needed
- verified businesses that want predictable operations and invoices

## Product (V1)

- Listings, discovery, search, categories
- Chat (pre-sale and post-sale)
- Checkout + orders + refunds (minimum viable)
- Seller onboarding via Stripe Connect
- Payout release rules + dispute intake
- Moderation basics (reports/blocks)
- Ratings & reviews (minimum viable)

## Business model (hybrid Buyer Protection)

- Personal sellers: **0% seller fee** (keep 100%)
- Buyers: **Buyer Protection** fee (percent + fixed, capped)
- Businesses: small seller fee (0.5–1.5%) + lower buyer fee on higher tiers
- Subscriptions reduce fees and unlock tools for heavy sellers (especially businesses)

## Why we win (moat)

- Trust system + operational playbooks (hard to copy quickly)
- Low-fee model with clear buyer value (stronger retention)
- Modern UX, mobile-first execution
- Compounding data (fraud patterns, conversion, category performance)

## Go-to-market (initial)

- Seed supply with trusted sellers and businesses (quality inventory)
- Launch with strong trust messaging (“No COD. Buyer Protection. Verified sellers.”)
- Growth loops: SEO listings, referrals, seller tools, partnerships

## Key risks (and our stance)

- Fraud: mitigate with verification, limits, monitoring, strict dispute process
- Payment failures/webhooks: treat webhooks as source of truth and build idempotency
- Support load: build tooling early (admin docs, macros, workflows)
