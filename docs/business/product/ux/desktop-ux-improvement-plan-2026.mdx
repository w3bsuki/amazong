# Desktop Improvement Plan 2026

This is a working plan. Convert items into `/admin/tasks` as implementation starts.

## Priorities

1. Speed: reduce UI friction (search, filters, checkout)
2. Trust: make protection, verification, and reviews obvious
3. Conversion: clearer CTAs and onboarding prompts

## TODO (backlog)

- Improve first-visit CTA (“Buy” vs “Sell”)
- Reduce filter complexity (mobile first)
- Add trust badges in listing cards and checkout
