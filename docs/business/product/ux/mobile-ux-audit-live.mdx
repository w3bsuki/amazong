## 🐛 Issues Found

### Critical Issues (Must Fix Before Launch)

1. **FAQ Page Routing Bug** ❌
   - **URL:** `/en/faq`
   - **Expected:** FAQ page content
   - **Actual:** "Profile Not Found" error
   - **Cause:** Route is being caught by `[username]` dynamic route
   - **Fix Required:** Add explicit `/en/faq` route or exclude 'faq' from username matching

### Minor Issues (Should Fix)

1. **Mobile Menu Button Test Selector** ⚠️
   - Menu button HTML has `data-slot="button"` and `aria-haspopup="menu"` but test couldn't reliably find it

2. **Product Links on Homepage** ⚠️
   - Test couldn't find product links with generic selector
