# docs/archive — Historical Reference (NOT SSOT)

This folder contains **historical snapshots and one-off planning docs** that are **not canonical**.

## Rules

- SSOT docs live in `docs/` and are linked from `docs/00-INDEX.md`.
- Runtime/high-churn work lives in `.codex/` (tasks, active refactor workspace, audit notes).
- Treat anything in `docs/archive/` as **reference only**; if something becomes canonical, promote it into `docs/` and link it from `docs/00-INDEX.md`.
