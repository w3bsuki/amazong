# DEC-002: Category Navigation

## Context

Category UX determines discoverability and conversion. We need a hierarchy that works on mobile and desktop.

## Decision

- Use a **sell-tree** flow for listing (guided selection).
- Use a browse tree for discovery with:
  - top categories → subcategories → filters.

## Consequences

- Requires a stable category taxonomy and display order.
- Needs good search fallback if users can’t find a category quickly.

## Open questions

- Do we allow multi-category listings (usually no; increases noise)?
- How do we handle “Other” buckets without turning them into dumps?
