# Buyer Protection (Help)

> What Buyer Protection means on Treido.

---

## overview: Overview

Treido is designed to make marketplace transactions safer by keeping payments on-platform and providing a structured resolution process when something goes wrong.

Buyer Protection is not a blanket guarantee for every situation. Coverage depends on eligibility, evidence, and policy rules.

## what-it-covers: What it can cover

Examples of issues that are commonly eligible for review:

- Item not received (within defined delivery windows)
- Item significantly not as described
- Item arrives damaged (when shipping damage is supported by evidence)

## what-it-does-not-cover: What it does not cover

Examples that may be ineligible:

- Buyer remorse / “changed my mind” (unless the policy explicitly allows it)
- Issues caused by inaccurate delivery information provided by the buyer
- Prohibited items and transactions that violate platform rules

## how-to-use: How to use it

1) Use on-platform checkout.
2) Keep communication in Treido chat.
3) If there’s an issue, open a dispute within the required timeframe and provide evidence.
