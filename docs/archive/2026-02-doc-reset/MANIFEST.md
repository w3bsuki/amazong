| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Cutover date | 2026-02-13 |
| Archive owner | treido-orchestrator |
| Source tree | legacy `docs/` |
| Active target | lean `docs/` |

## Archived Source

- Full legacy snapshot moved to:
- `docs/archive/2026-02-doc-reset/pre-cutover-docs/`

## Restored Runtime Docs

- `docs/public/**` copied back from pre-cutover snapshot to preserve runtime legal/help content.

## Notes

- Legacy workflow/process docs are retained only in archive.
- New active docs are intentionally minimal and pointer-first.
