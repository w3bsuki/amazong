# Privacy Policy (Draft)

This is a working draft for Treido Marketplace. It is **not legal advice**.

## 1) Who we are

Treido (“we”, “us”, “our”) operates a marketplace platform that enables buyers and sellers to list items, communicate, and transact using on-platform payments.

## 2) Scope

This policy describes how we process personal data when you:

- create an account,
- browse and use the marketplace,
- list items for sale,
- purchase items,
- message other users,
- contact support.

## 3) Data we collect

### Account & profile data

- email, phone number, username/display name
- profile photo (optional)
- account type (personal vs business)
- verification flags (e.g. phone verified)

### Marketplace content

- listings you create (photos, description, category, condition, price)
- interactions (favorites/wishlist, follows, messages)

### Transaction data

- orders, order statuses, receipts
- payment metadata (e.g. Stripe payment identifiers, amounts)
- shipping/delivery details where applicable (e.g. addresses and tracking)

### Safety & support data

- reports, dispute evidence, moderation actions
- support tickets and communications

### Technical data

- device and usage information (e.g. IP address, logs, browser/device signals)
- cookies/local storage where required for session/security

## 4) Why we process data (purposes)

- Provide and operate the marketplace (accounts, listings, orders, messaging)
- Process payments and payouts (via Stripe and Stripe Connect)
- Prevent fraud and keep the platform safe (monitoring, enforcement, audits)
- Customer support and dispute resolution
- Legal compliance (tax/accounting retention, KYC/KYB/AML where applicable)
- Product improvement (aggregate analytics; minimize personal data)

## 5) Service providers & sharing

We share data only as needed to run Treido, for example with:

- **Stripe** (payments and Connect onboarding/payouts)
- **Supabase** (database, authentication, storage)
- email/SMS providers (account notifications, security messages)
- analytics/monitoring providers (if enabled)

We do not sell personal data.

## 6) KYC/KYB and payment data

Where possible, identity and business verification is handled through Stripe Connect onboarding. We aim to minimize sensitive data stored on our systems.

## 7) Retention

Retention periods depend on the data category and legal requirements. As a baseline:

- order/transaction data: retained for accounting/legal obligations
- support/dispute data: retained for the dispute window + audit needs
- chat data: retained as needed for user experience and safety (subject to retention policy)

See also: [Data Governance & Retention](/business/ops/data-governance).

## 8) Your rights (EU/EEA / GDPR)

Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights such as:

- access, correction, deletion
- objection and restriction
- portability

## 9) Security

We use technical and organizational measures designed to protect personal data (access controls, logging, least privilege, and secure storage).

## 10) Changes

We may update this policy and will provide appropriate notice when required.
