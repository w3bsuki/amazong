# Codex — User Prompt (verbatim)

**Captured:** 2026-02-01

I want you to prepare a complete ui and ux finalization for production.
i want us to lock down mobile first.
patternsm ust be similar on desktop.
currently, when users sign up, they choose personal/business profile during sign up, but this must happen during onboarding, not in sign in / sign up form.
when they log in for the first time ,they must get onboarding, choosing personal/business profile -> next screen -> uploading info. for business, they must be able to tailro their profile a lot more, they must be able to have a button to export products via csv or whatever our /dashboard and supabase allows, and our nextjs can show.
we need to make the business experience like shopify backend with best frontend we can build.
its 2026, current website patterns are moving. I no longer feel like old web designs and patterns with many buttons etc are convenient.
People are getting used to seemless native perfect UI and UX, and most of it happens trhough ai agents.
we must utilize our ai agent everywhere we can for our platform.
We must make it the best ui and ux possible. After isgn in, users must onboard and select account type -> Personal/business. personal -> upload profile picture, create store name (use profile name) -> here users must select their user name, and it must tell them that hey can only change it once after htey choose it. premium profiles will be bale to change names.
after htey select name/business/personal profile, personal ones must select avatar, location. businesses can add business name, vat numbers, websites, physical store location, facebook/instagram pages/links to their business.
the landing page must be seemless ui and ux.
we currently have clean quick pills. i just feel like our main page could be slightly better, im thinking something like a mix between social media feed and trading platform, because the current horizontal sections are too boring.
users when they list, must be able to find products. i feel like having these horizontal ones is oldschool design patterns. i feel like we can utilize drawers more, ai search etc. for example, in the landing we have quick pills to saerch for main categories. this is good, but i feel like the ui and ux can be slightly better. i feel like in the landing page instead of collections, we should show these horizontal sections but tehy should be like store sections, example: instead of Fashion title and products, there will be user profile (avatar) and images under it, u ge tthe idea?
then the search will be much better, we need to show our ai seacrh better.
I feel like bottom navbar "Обяви" could be renamed to "search" and it could show the current drawer with categories, but it could also have ai seacrh drawer? or? bnottom navbar can be improved?
I have seen you build native applike nextjs projects, i think u are using framer motion etc. however, shadcn/tailwicndssv4 for b2b/c2c ecommerce we still need to make it look a bit like ecommerce.
we need to create this hype design and style. social media mixed with ecommerce, ebay mixed with facebook for example.
the social aspect is rly important. i feel like the bottom navbar perfect button s would be:
Home / Buy / Sell / Sellers / Profile , or maybe chat can be there. we currently have good patterns, but we need to finalzie the ui and ux, onboarding, mobile ui and ux in landing, pages etc.
Currently our product page on mobiel is beginning to look more like a mobile app page, with the tabs for info/seller
i feel like we can do better.
do u thinkwe should keep the circles or quick pills in the landing? if we do the cirlces on top for main categories, and they open the drawers, we could remove the quick pills. howver the quick pills were fine with the circles appearing udner. but if we keep circles only, ti will look mroe like instagram (familiar pattern->good), instagram has stories there, w will just have main actegories.when user clicks a circle, it can open the drawer instead of flooding and shifting our mobile layout with contextual pills,etc?
What dou say? is this proper, or not?
is drawer worse than having inline pills, contextual pills?
can u paste this entire prompt in a n .md file, because i will later forget it. we need to fully plan the ui and ux refactor. mayeb create a folder called /uirefactor and lets start plannign every single aspect, botherwise we will fail. we need to get to production, but i want our trading platform to be better than ebay, et.c we ned to plan this. please create the plans in the /uirefactor folder, once u do, please discuss this with codex MCP, and iterate on the plans u creted with him. plan how to properly implement it in our project, weneed to clean up all dogshit ui and uxand improve it, and ifnalize the mobile ui adn ux. the simplest the better. im just not sure if i for exaple want the landing page quick pills or cirlce,s if i want circles to open drawer or if i want quick pilsl to open contextual icrlces below. idk whats better. u neeed to ultrathink and deepthink, and help me. in the plans, we should write down this prompt as .md file so we can reiterate on it, we can improve the idea, see waht my issues/struggles are, and plan it properly in phases

I sent this prompt to opus 4.5, whe will create the ui refactor folder.
your job is to use that folder, and create ur own iteration of this prompt and plan, and all .md files must be named with codex_ prefix. dont touch opus files he will be creating there , plan on ur own files with codex_
