# PROMPT-GUIDE.md — Treido Prompt Standard

Use this format to get predictable, high-quality results.

## One Prompt Packet

```text
Goal:
<1-2 sentences>

Scope:
<paths/routes to change>

Do not touch:
<paths/features to keep unchanged>

Docs to follow:
<docs/*.md references>

Done means:
<expected behavior and outputs>

Verification:
<exact commands to run>

Risk:
<low-risk | high-risk>
```

## Minimal Examples

### Implement

Scope:
components/mobile/category-nav/*

Do not touch:
data fetching or backend logic

Docs to follow:
docs/DESIGN.md
docs/WORKFLOW.md

Done means:
consistent spacing, no regression in active states

Verification:
pnpm -s typecheck
pnpm -s lint
pnpm -s styles:gate

Risk:
low-risk
```

### Review

```text
Goal:
Review checkout auth flow for bugs and regressions.

Scope:
app/[locale]/(checkout)/**
app/[locale]/(auth)/**

Do not touch:
no code changes, review only

Docs to follow:
docs/AUTH.md
docs/WORKFLOW.md

Done means:
findings ordered by severity with file references

Verification:
none

Risk:
high-risk
```

### Plan

```text
Goal:
Plan migration from numbered docs links to semantic docs links.

Scope:
docs/**

Do not touch:
application runtime code

Docs to follow:
docs/INDEX.md
docs/DOCS-PLAN.md

Done means:
decision-complete plan with sequence, risks, and checks

Verification:
pnpm -s docs:check

Risk:
low-risk
```

## Prompt Anti-Patterns

- "Fix this" without scope.
- Missing "Do not touch".
- Missing verification commands.
- High-risk requests without explicitly labeling risk.
