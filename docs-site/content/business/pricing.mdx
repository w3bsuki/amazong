# Plans & Pricing (Treido.eu)

Plans are split by account type:

- **Personal** users live under `/account`
- **Business** users can unlock `/dashboard` with a paid plan

Pricing is displayed in **BGN** (with EUR equivalents where needed). Annual billing is 20% cheaper than monthly.

## Personal plans

- Do not sell “team seats” or “API access” until implemented.
