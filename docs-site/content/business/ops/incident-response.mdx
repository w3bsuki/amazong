# Incident Response

This is the operational playbook for production incidents (payments, security, downtime).

## Severity levels

- **SEV-0**: payouts/payments broken, security incident, data leak risk
- **SEV-1**: checkout degraded, large portion of users affected
- **SEV-2**: partial outage or major feature degraded
- **SEV-3**: minor issue, workaround exists

## Roles

- Incident commander (IC): owns coordination
- Scribe: notes timeline and actions
- Owner: resolves technical root cause

## Process

1. Declare severity and owner
2. Mitigate (stop bleeding)
3. Diagnose root cause
4. Resolve and verify
5. Write postmortem + follow-up tasks

## Communications (internal first)

- keep updates short and timestamped
- do not share secrets/PII

## Payments incidents
