# Support Playbook (V1)

This playbook defines how Treido handles refunds, disputes, and support requests during launch.

## Goals

- Fast, predictable outcomes (reduce uncertainty and fraud)
- Protect Stripe standing (keep chargebacks low)
- Treat buyers and sellers fairly with evidence-based decisions

## Intake and triage

Support requests should be tagged as one of:

- **pre-shipment cancellation**
- **item not received**
- **damaged**
- **not as described**
- **counterfeit**
- **harassment / abuse**
- **account / verification**
- **payments / technical**

## SLAs (launch targets)

- First response: same day for payments/disputes, otherwise within 24h
- Dispute decision: within 48h once evidence is complete

## Refund types (baseline)

- **Full refund**: default for seller no-ship, confirmed INR, confirmed counterfeit
- **Partial refund**: only with clear mutual agreement or obvious partial damage
- **No refund**: if evidence supports seller and policy requirements are met

## Evidence checklist (minimum)

Depending on dispute type, request:

- order timeline (paid/shipped/delivered)
- tracking details and delivery confirmation
- photos (damage, packaging, authenticity signals)
- listing content (description, condition, images)
- chat excerpts relevant to the claim

## Communication rules

- Be clear about timelines and next steps.
- Do not reveal internal fraud signals.
- Keep messages short and policy-linked.

## Escalations

Escalate to engineering when:

- webhook/order state mismatch is suspected
- payout release bug is suspected
- multiple similar payment failures appear (issuer/systemic)

Escalate to trust & safety when:

- counterfeit indicators appear
- repeated abuse patterns appear (same user, similar pattern)
