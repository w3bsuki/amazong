# Launch Plan

## Objective

Ship a safe MVP to production, validate product-market fit, then iterate fast.

## Pre-launch (T-30 → T-7)

- Finalize policies (returns/refunds, prohibited items, KYC)
- Verify Stripe Connect onboarding and webhooks
- Create support macros and dispute workflows
- Seed initial supply (trusted sellers, partnerships)

## Launch week (T-7 → T+7)

- Gradual rollout (invite / waitlist if needed)
- Daily monitoring: payments, disputes, fraud signals, crash rate
- Rapid bugfixing with strict rollback rules

## Post-launch (T+7 → T+30)

- Improve onboarding conversion (sell vs buy CTA)
- Add missing features discovered in real usage
- Start growth loops (referrals, SEO, partnerships)
