# Docs Governance

Treido documentation lives in three layers:

## 1) Canonical engineering docs (`/docs`)

- Source of truth for **code and production rails**.
- Keep it small and consistent.

## 2) Docs site (`/docs-site`)

- Internal “company docs”: product, ops, legal drafts, investor pack.
- Should not contradict canonical rails.

## 3) Admin docs (`/admin/docs`)

- Operational docs editable by admins (runbooks, plans, meeting notes).
- Use seed templates to bootstrap, then iterate as a team.

## Change process

- For big changes (fees, scope, payout rules): write a DEC first.
- Keep open questions explicit and close them one by one.
- Prefer small edits over rewrites.

## Naming

- Brand is **Treido**.
- URLs in docs should match `https://treido.eu`.
