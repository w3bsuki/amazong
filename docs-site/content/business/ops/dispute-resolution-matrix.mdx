# Dispute Resolution Matrix (V1)

This matrix makes decisions predictable. Adjust only via a documented decision (DEC).

## Standard dispute types

| Dispute type | Required evidence | Default outcome | SLA | Notes |
|-------------|-------------------|-----------------|-----|------|
| Seller did not ship | no tracking after ship window | refund buyer | 24–48h | cancel order, refund, warn seller |
| Item not received (INR) | tracking + carrier confirmation | refund if delivery fails | 24–72h | if marked delivered, request buyer evidence |
| Damaged item | photos of item + packaging | partial/full refund | 48h | severity-based; repeated patterns escalate |
| Not as described | photos + listing mismatch | partial/full refund | 48h | requires clear mismatch |
| Counterfeit | photos + authenticity indicators | refund buyer + ban path | 48h | high priority, preserve evidence |
| Harassment/abuse | chat excerpts | enforcement action | 24h | may include account restrictions |

## Auto-confirm window (open decision)

- Choose **48h or 72h** after delivery for auto-confirm.
- Document the final decision and enforce consistently.

## Payout release safety

- If a dispute is opened, payout release must be blocked until resolved.
- Any payout bug is a stop-the-line incident.
