# Roadmap

This roadmap is scoped for a **full marketplace launch** (Vinted-style), not classifieds.

## V1 (Launch): full marketplace with Buyer Protection

Must-have (ship to production):

- Listings: create/edit, photos, categories, search/browse
- Chat: buyer ↔ seller (pre-sale) + order messaging (post-sale)
- Checkout: Stripe payments on-platform + Buyer Protection fee
- Orders: lifecycle, status tracking, receipts
- Payouts: Stripe Connect onboarding + delayed release after delivery confirmation
- Ratings/reviews: seller + product (minimum viable)
- Trust & safety: reports, blocks, moderation tooling
- Basic returns/refunds + dispute intake
- Notifications: order updates + important account events

Hard gates (no launch without these):

- Webhook correctness + idempotency (payment succeeded/failed/refund/chargeback)
- Refund policy + support playbooks written and tested
- Fraud prevention basics (rate limits, seller limits, monitoring)
- KYC/KYB path defined (Stripe Connect + platform-side checks)

## V1.1–V1.3 (post-launch)

- Shipping carrier integrations (tracking + delivery confirmation automation)
- Better dispute resolution tooling + evidence uploads
- Seller onboarding improvements and education
- Performance + SEO polishing
- Reputation iteration (badges/levels, stronger seller stats)

## V2: AI & growth

- AI Listing Assistant (title/description/category suggestions)
- AI Search/Shopping Assistant (paid add-on or plan perk)
- More advanced analytics for businesses
- Internationalization expansion (markets + languages)
- Early B2B features (directory, verified-only introductions)

## V3: platform scale

- Mobile apps (Capacitor or native)
- Internal ops automation (fraud scoring, moderation queues)
- Partnerships and logistics options
- Optional B2B networking chat (if moderation capacity is strong)
