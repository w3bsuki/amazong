# Monetization Model (Treido.eu)

How Treido earns revenue across phases.

## V1 (classifieds-first): paid promotions

V1 matches OLX.bg / Bazar.bg behavior: buyers and sellers message and agree on shipping/payment off-platform.

We monetize with **visibility upgrades**:

| Product | Purpose | Duration | Price (EUR) |
|--------|---------|----------|-------------|
| Boost | Higher rank in search/category | 24h | €0.99 |
| Boost | Higher rank in search/category | 7d | €4.99 |
| Boost | Higher rank in search/category | 30d | €14.99 |
| Urgent badge | “urgent” trust/attention | 3d | €0.49 |
| Category top | Slot on category page | 24h | €1.49 |
| Homepage featured | Slot on homepage | 24h | €2.99 |

Implementation note: promotions can be sold via Stripe Checkout without Stripe Connect (no seller payouts).

## V2 (payments): buyer protection fee + payouts

V2 introduces:

- Card payments on-platform
- Seller payouts via Stripe Connect (Express)

Recommended fee model:

- Seller fee: **0%**
- Buyer pays a transparent **Buyer Protection** fee to use checkout

Initial buyer fee target:

- **4% + 1.00 BGN**, cap at **39 BGN**
