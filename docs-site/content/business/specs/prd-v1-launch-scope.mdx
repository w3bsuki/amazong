# PRD: V1 Launch Scope

## Objective

Launch a complete marketplace experience that users can trust for real transactions.

## V1 must-have features

- Auth and onboarding (buyer and seller paths)
- Listings: create/edit, photos, categories, search and browse
- Chat: buyer ↔ seller (pre-sale)
- Checkout and orders (Stripe)
- Seller onboarding (Stripe Connect Express)
- Order tracking + delivery confirmation
- Ratings/reviews (minimum viable)
- Reports/blocks + moderation workflows

## V1 out of scope (explicit)

- International expansion (multi-country tax complexity)
- Complex multi-warehouse logistics
- Ads platform (later)

## Open questions

- Exact set of supported delivery carriers for V1
- Auto-confirm window (72h vs 48h) after delivery
