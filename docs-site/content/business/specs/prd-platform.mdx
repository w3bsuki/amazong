# PRD: Treido Platform (Ultimate)

This document is the **single source of truth** for what Treido is building, why, and what “done” means for launch.

> Status: draft. Update together with monetization, payments, and trust/safety PRDs.

## 1) Product vision

Treido is a Bulgarian-first marketplace for safe second-hand and B2B trade, designed to keep transactions on-platform via:

- transparent buyer protection,
- predictable dispute outcomes,
- fast payouts with Stripe Connect,
- low friction for personal sellers (0% seller fee).

## 2) Target users & jobs-to-be-done

### Personal seller (C2C)
- List quickly, sell fast, get paid safely.

### Personal buyer (C2C)
- Buy with confidence, avoid scams, get support if anything goes wrong.

### Business seller (B2B/B2C)
- Sell at scale with tooling, predictable fees, invoicing readiness, and trust signals.

## 3) Core scope (V1)

### Marketplace
- Listings CRUD (photos, condition, attributes)
- Browse/search/categories
- Product detail pages

### Messaging
- Buyer ↔ seller chat
- Reporting + blocking

### Checkout & orders
- Stripe checkout on-platform
- Orders lifecycle statuses
- Buyer issue reporting entry points

### Payouts
- Stripe Connect Express onboarding
- Payout release rules (escrow-style logic)

### Trust & safety
- Prohibited items enforcement
- Basic moderation workflows
- Minimum viable ratings/reviews

## 4) Explicit non-scope (V1)

## 5) Key policies (V1)

- Returns/refunds policy + dispute matrix
- Prohibited items policy
- KYC/KYB/AML posture (primarily via Stripe)

## 6) Monetization (V1)

- Hybrid Buyer Protection fee model (buyer pays) + business seller fee

## 7) Reputation & gamification (V1 → V1.1)

## 8) Future: B2B networking

Optional module: private networking chat for verified businesses/distributors with strong moderation and anti-spam controls.

See: [PRD: B2B Networking (Future)](/business/specs/prd-b2b-networking-chat).

## 9) Success metrics

- conversion (PDP → checkout → paid)
- dispute rate + resolution time
- chargeback rate
- seller payout success rate
