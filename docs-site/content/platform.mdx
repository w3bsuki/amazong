# Platform Overview

Treido is a marketplace built for safe **C2C** and **B2B** commerce with on-platform payments and a clear buyer protection model.

## What Treido is

- A listings marketplace (browse, search, categories, product pages)
- Buyer ↔ seller chat
- On-platform checkout (Stripe) + seller payouts (Stripe Connect)
- Trust & safety primitives (reports, blocks, moderation)
- Reputation layer (ratings/reviews; badges/levels planned)

## What Treido is not (V1)

- Cash on delivery (COD)
- An off-platform “send your IBAN” marketplace
- An unmoderated public community / forum

## Core flows

1. **Sell**: create listing → chat with buyers → accept order → ship → payout released
2. **Buy**: discover listing → chat → checkout → receive → confirm or dispute
3. **Support**: refunds, disputes, prohibited items, and enforcement

## Revenue model (summary)

- Personal sellers: **0% seller fee**
- Businesses: **small seller fee**
- Buyers: **Buyer Protection fee** (percent + fixed, capped)
