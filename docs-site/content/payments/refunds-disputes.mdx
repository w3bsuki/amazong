# Refunds, Disputes & Chargebacks

## Refunds (platform-initiated)

Refund flows should support:

- full refund (item not shipped / cancelled)
- partial refund (approved by support)

## Disputes (user-initiated)

Disputes should capture:

- reason codes (not received / not as described / counterfeit / damaged)
- evidence (photos, chat excerpts, tracking)
- timeline (SLA)

## Chargebacks (issuer-initiated)

- Assume some chargebacks will happen even with good UX.
- Maintain an operational playbook: evidence, response templates, and escalation.

## Policy alignment

- [Returns & refunds policy](/policies/returns)
