# Stripe Connect (Express)

## Goal

Enable seller payouts safely while keeping the platform in control of timing (escrow-style release).

## Account model

- Use **Express** accounts for most sellers (fast onboarding, Stripe handles KYC/KYB UX).
- Store:
  - `profiles.stripe_account_id`
  - `profiles.stripe_onboarding_complete`

## Money movement pattern

Recommended: **Separate Charges and Transfers**

- Buyer is charged on the **platform** account
- Funds are **transferred** to the connected account only after:
  - delivery confirmation, or
  - dispute resolution

Avoid destination charges if they auto-transfer immediately (reduces escrow control).

## Operational checklist

- Onboarding completion gate before allowing “Buy Now” for seller
- Payout scheduling by seller trust tier (new sellers held longer)
- Webhook-driven state (don’t trust client callbacks)

## Open questions

- Do we require phone verification before Stripe onboarding?
- Do we allow business KYB without a subscription plan, or require Business Free plan first?
