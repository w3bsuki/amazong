# WORKFLOW.md — Execution Workflow

> Single execution workflow for implement/review/plan work.

| Field | Value |

| Refresh cadence | Weekly + whenever gates or policies change |

## Task Loop

1. Frame: define goal, scope, non-goals, and risk lane.
2. Implement: ship scoped, reviewable batches.
3. Verify: run commands from `docs/QA.md` that match changed surface.
4. Report: include files changed, verification results, and risks/follow-ups.

## Risk Lanes

- `low-risk`: UI/docs/refactors/tests with no risky domain changes.
- `high-risk`: any touch to DB/auth/payments/destructive operations.
- High-risk work must follow `docs/RISK.md` stop-and-ask policy.

## Prompt Packet

```text
Mode:
<implement | review | plan | audit>

Goal:
<1-2 sentences>

Scope:
<paths/routes to change>

Do not touch:
<explicit exclusions>

Docs to follow:
AGENTS.md
docs/WORKFLOW.md
docs/QA.md
docs/RISK.md
<additional docs only if needed>

Done means:
<expected behavior and unchanged boundaries>

Verification:
<exact commands>

Risk:
<low-risk | high-risk>
```

## Verification Matrix

Use `docs/QA.md` as the source for which gates to run by change type.

## Report Format

Every implementation report must include:

1. Files changed (modified/created/deleted)
2. Verification commands + pass/fail outcomes
3. Assumptions, risks, deferred follow-ups
