# AGENT-MAP.md — Skill Reference (Optional)

> **This is a reference table, not a mandatory routing step.** For standard tasks, implement directly following the non-negotiables. Only consult this when you need specialist knowledge or the user explicitly asks to use skills/subagents (for example, `run subagents`).
