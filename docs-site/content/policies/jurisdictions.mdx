# Jurisdictions & Availability (Draft)

Internal planning document. Not legal advice.

## Purpose

Treido must only operate in jurisdictions where we can:

- legally provide a marketplace service,
- process payments via Stripe (including Connect),
- meet consumer protection and data protection requirements (e.g. GDPR),
- run KYC/KYB/AML where required (primarily via Stripe capabilities).

## Initial launch posture

- **Primary launch market:** Bulgaria
- **Expansion posture:** EU/EEA countries with Stripe + operational coverage (support, disputes, shipping)

## What determines whether a country is “supported”

### Payments & payouts

- Stripe availability for:
  - card payments in the buyer’s currency,
  - Stripe Connect payouts in the seller’s country,
  - required compliance capabilities (identity verification, business verification).

### Legal & compliance

- consumer protection (returns, unfair terms, dispute rights)
- data protection (GDPR for EU/EEA; local variants elsewhere)
- AML obligations depending on product/payment flow (use Stripe Connect where possible)
- sanctions and restricted territories (always excluded)

### Operations

- shipping coverage and tracking reliability (or clear shipping rules)
- dispute and support capacity (SLA, evidence handling, refunds)
- moderation language coverage (BG/EN at minimum)

## Country decision matrix (template)

Use this table as a checklist. “Yes” requires evidence/links stored internally.

| Country | Stripe Payments | Stripe Connect payouts | Ops coverage | Legal reviewed | Status |
|--------|------------------|------------------------|-------------|----------------|--------|
| Bulgaria | Yes | Yes | Yes | Pending | Launch |
| EU/EEA (target list) | Pending | Pending | Pending | Pending | Evaluate |
| Non‑EU (future) | Unknown | Unknown | Unknown | Unknown | Not planned |

## Required artifacts (before enabling a country)

- Written legal opinion or counsel review notes
- Updated Terms/Privacy that cover the jurisdiction
- Support playbooks and moderation coverage
- Monitoring + incident response readiness
