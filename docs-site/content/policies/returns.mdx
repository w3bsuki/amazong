# Returns & Refunds

## Goals

- Make outcomes predictable (buyers and sellers know the rules).
- Reduce fraud while keeping the experience simple.

## Baseline rules (V1)

- Payments happen **on-platform** (Stripe). COD is not supported.
- Refunds are processed through Stripe (no off-platform refunds).

## Refund eligibility (examples)

- Item not shipped within the allowed window → cancel + refund
- Item not received (tracking shows failure) → dispute → refund if confirmed
- Item not as described / damaged / counterfeit → dispute + evidence

## Process

1. Buyer opens dispute (reason + evidence)
2. Seller responds within SLA
3. Support reviews and decides:
   - refund buyer, or
   - release funds to seller, or
   - partial refund

## Open decisions

- Return shipping label policy (buyer-paid vs seller-paid vs platform-paid)
- Default return window length (e.g. 48–72h after delivery)
