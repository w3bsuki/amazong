# KYC / KYB / AML

## Goal

Prevent fraud and meet payment-provider requirements.

## What Stripe covers

- Stripe Connect onboarding collects identity/banking info for payouts.
- For businesses, Stripe can collect KYB details.

## What the platform should cover

- Phone verification (anti-spam, account recovery)
- Risk scoring (new sellers, high-price items, rapid listing)
- Manual review workflow (first sale, flagged disputes)

## Data handling

- Minimize what we store (prefer Stripe-hosted onboarding).
- Define retention for verification artifacts.
