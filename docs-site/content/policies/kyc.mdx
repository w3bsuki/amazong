# KYC / KYB / AML (Policy)

> Identity and business verification posture for Treido.

---

## Overview

Treido may require identity verification (KYC) or business verification (KYB) to comply with payment-provider and legal requirements.

## Payment-provider verification

Where available, onboarding and verification may be handled through payment-provider flows (for example, Stripe Connect onboarding).

## Data minimization

Treido aims to minimize sensitive data stored on our systems and rely on providers for regulated verification flows when possible.
