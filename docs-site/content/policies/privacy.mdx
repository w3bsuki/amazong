# Privacy Policy

> This policy explains what personal data Treido processes, why, and what choices you have.

---

Treido is built to minimize sensitive data and to use access controls and least privilege. This document describes our baseline privacy posture.

## Who we are

Treido operates a marketplace platform that enables users to list items, communicate, and transact using on-platform payments.

## Scope

This policy explains how we process personal data when you:

- create and use an account,
- browse and interact with listings,
- message other users,
- buy or sell items,
- contact support.

## Data we collect

We may process:

- account and profile data (email, phone, username, profile info),
- content you provide (listings, messages),
- transaction data (orders, payment identifiers, amounts),
- safety/support data (reports, disputes, evidence),
- technical data (device signals, logs, cookies needed for security/session).

## Why we process data

We process data to:

- provide and operate the Service,
- process payments and payouts via providers,
- prevent fraud and enforce policies,
- provide customer support and dispute resolution,
- comply with legal obligations.

## Service providers and sharing

We may share data with service providers needed to operate Treido (for example: payment processing, hosting, email/SMS). We do not sell personal data.

## Cookies

We use cookies where necessary for security, session management, and core functionality. See the Cookie Policy for details.

## Security

We use technical and organizational measures designed to protect personal data (access controls, least privilege, secure storage).

## Retention

Retention depends on category and legal obligations (for example: accounting retention for transaction data). We aim to keep data no longer than necessary.

## Your rights

Depending on your jurisdiction (including GDPR in the EU/EEA), you may have rights such as access, correction, deletion, objection, restriction, and portability.

## Changes to this policy

We may update this policy and will provide notice when required.
