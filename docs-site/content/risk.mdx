## Stop-And-Ask Domains

Stop and align with a human before finalizing changes to:

- DB schema, migrations, or RLS policy behavior
- Auth/session/access control behavior
- Payments/webhooks/billing logic
- Destructive or bulk data operations

## Approval Log Format

Record approval in the task response or audit note using:

```text
Risk Domain:
Requested Change:
Human Approval:
Date:
Rollback Plan:
```

## Rollback Expectations

- Describe rollback path before finalizing high-risk changes.
- Prefer reversible, small-batch migrations.
- If rollback is unclear, pause and resolve before merging.
