# Agent Fleet Roadmap (DEPRECATED)

> Treido no longer uses a “fleet orchestration” model. The repo now follows **Skills V4**: a small set of **specialist** `treido-*` skills.

**Current (V4) skills:**
- `treido-rails` — non-negotiables + pause conditions
- `treido-structure` — file placement + boundaries
- `treido-design` — UI/UX specs + polish
- `treido-mobile-ux` — touch + safe areas + iOS feel
- `treido-nextjs-16` — App Router + caching + request conventions
- `treido-tailwind-v4` — tokens + forbidden patterns
- `treido-shadcn-ui` — primitives + composition
- `treido-supabase` — SSR clients + queries + RLS mindset
- `treido-stripe` — webhooks + payments safety
- `treido-skillsmith` — skill system maintenance

**Legacy (V1) skills:**
- Legacy skill artifacts are intentionally removed to keep the fleet small and current.

For day-to-day work:
- Start at `docs/AGENTS.md`
- Follow `docs/WORKFLOW.md`
- Reference `docs/SKILLS.md`
