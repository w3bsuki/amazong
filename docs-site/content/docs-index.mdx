# INDEX.md — Treido Docs Map

Canonical docs map for humans and AI agents.

## Start Here

If you read only three docs, read:

1. `docs/AGENTS.md` — execution contract and risk policy.
2. `docs/WORKFLOW.md` — implementation and verification loop.
3. `docs/PRD.md` — product scope and launch criteria.

## Core Canonical Docs

| Area | Canonical Doc |
|---|---|
| Project map | `docs/INDEX.md` |
| Product definition | `docs/PRD.md` |
| Feature status | `docs/FEATURES.md` |
| Architecture | `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` |
| UI/UX rules | `docs/DESIGN.md` |
| Routes | `docs/ROUTES.md` |
| Database | `docs/DATABASE.md` |
| API and actions | `docs/API.md` |

## Runtime State (Operational)

| Decisions/ADRs | `.codex/DECISIONS.md` |
| Shipped history | `.codex/SHIPPED.md` |

## Non-Canonical and Generated Zones

- `docs-site/**`:
  - internal browse portal generated from `docs/**`.
  - not an authoring source.
- `docs/archive/**`:
  - historical snapshots and deprecated material.
  - not active SSOT.
- numbered docs such as `docs/01-PRD.md`:
  - compatibility stubs only.
  - do not use as canonical links.

## Query Recipes (For AI + Humans)

- "How far are we from launch?"
  - use `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/FEATURES.md`, and `docs/status/LAUNCH-READINESS.yaml`.
- "What should I change for this feature?"
  - use `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/ROUTES.md`, and `docs/WORKFLOW.md`.
- "Which skill should handle this?"
  - use `docs/AGENT-MAP.md` and `docs/SKILLS.md`.
