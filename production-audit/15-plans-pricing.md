- Billing toggle: `flex items-center gap-3`, switch component between Monthly/Annual labels.
- Toggling either control updates pricing cards without page reload (client-side state in `PlansPageClient`).
- Annual pricing shows discounted amounts with savings indicator.
- Toggle state is visually clear — active state is unambiguous on mobile.
- Both toggles fit within 390px viewport without overflow or wrapping.

**Expected:**
- Comparison table renders all plans as columns with features as rows.
- Table container enables horizontal scroll on mobile — table is not squished to fit.
- Feature name column ideally stays sticky (position: sticky) during horizontal scroll for readability.
- Check/cross icons are clearly distinguishable at mobile size.
- Horizontal scroll is contained within the table container — does not affect the page-level scroll.

- `PlansContent` component renders the user's current plan with name, billing period, and status.
- Available upgrade options or plan comparison is accessible from this page.
- Layout is mobile-optimized within the account layout shell.
- Loading state from `loading.tsx` displays skeleton before content hydrates.

| 12 | 📸 Screenshot | `phase-15-S15.7-upgrade-modal.png` — upgrade modal open over account plans |

**Expected:**
- Intercepting route pattern: navigating from `/account/plans` opens upgrade in a modal (`@modal/(.)account/plans/upgrade`).
- Direct navigation to `/account/plans/upgrade` renders as full page (standard Next.js intercepting route behavior).
- Modal is appropriately sized for mobile — full-width or near-full-width with rounded top.
- Modal content is scrollable if it exceeds viewport height.
- Dismissing the modal returns to the previous page without full reload (client-side navigation).
- Upgrade content shows plan options with pricing and selection CTA.

### S15.8 — Loading Skeleton: Horizontal Card Scroll on Mobile

**Route:** `/plans`

| Step | Action | Selector / Target |
|------|--------|--------------------|
| 1 | Throttle network to slow 3G | Playwright `page.route('**/*', ...)` with delay, or CDP network throttling |

| 5 | Swipe skeleton cards horizontally | Horizontal gesture on skeleton container |
| 6 | Verify snap behavior on skeleton cards | Cards snap to center positions during scroll |
| 7 | Wait for actual content to replace skeleton | `PlansPageClient` renders, skeleton dismissed |
| 8 | Verify transition from skeleton to content is clean | No layout shift or flash between skeleton and real content |
| 9 | 📸 Screenshot | `phase-15-S15.8-loading-skeleton.png` — skeleton cards in horizontal scroll |

**Expected:**
- Loading skeleton renders card placeholders in a horizontal scroll container (mobile behavior).
- Cards use `snap-center shrink-0` for horizontal snap scrolling.
- Skeleton cards match the approximate dimensions of real pricing cards.
- Transition from skeleton to real content is seamless — no jarring layout shift (CLS).
- Skeleton is visible long enough to validate on throttled network.

## Findings

| ID | Scenario | Status | Notes |
|----|----------|--------|-------|
| PLANS-001 | S15.3 | ⚠ Open (P1) | Current-plan match logic treats `currentTier === "free"` as equivalent to `basic` card in public plans (`plans-page-client.tsx:400`). |
| PLANS-002 | S15.6 | ⚠ Open (P2) | Account plans "boost" block hardcodes BGN (`лв`) values in otherwise EUR-based plan UX (`plans-content.tsx:500`, `507`, `511`). |
| PLANS-I18N-003 | Cross-cutting | ⚠ Open (P2) | Large volume of inline `locale === "bg"` strings across plans/account plans instead of centralized translation keys. |
| S15.7 | Upgrade modal route | ✅ Pass | `@modal/(.)account/plans/upgrade` correctly enforces auth and loads upgrade content. |

Phase 15 covers the plans and pricing surface across 3 routes spanning 2 layout groups (`(plans)`, `(account)`) plus an intercepting modal route. The public plans page uses `PlansPageClient` with 5 distinct sections requiring vertical scroll validation. Key mobile-specific risks include the pricing card grid collapsing from 5 columns (XL) to 1 column (mobile), the comparison table requiring horizontal scroll containment, and the loading skeleton using `snap-center shrink-0` horizontal card scroll. The `PricingCard` compound component (Card, Header, Plan, Price, Body, List) must render all subcomponents without truncation at 390px. The upgrade flow uses Next.js intercepting routes (`@modal/(.)account/plans/upgrade`) requiring both modal and full-page rendering validation. No `data-testid` attributes exist — all selectors must rely on structural queries, text content, or ARIA roles.
