# Data Governance & Retention (V1)

This is an internal draft. Align with legal counsel before publishing externally.

## Principles

- least privilege access
- minimize stored sensitive data (prefer Stripe-hosted onboarding)
- clear retention windows
- auditability for admin actions

## Data categories

- PII (email, phone, addresses)
- payments metadata (Stripe ids, order totals)
- chat content (user messages)
- trust artifacts (dispute evidence, moderation logs)
- internal ops docs (admin docs/tasks/notes)

## Retention (draft defaults)

- Orders: retain for legal/accounting requirements (define window)
- Chat: retain only as needed for disputes and safety (define window)
- Dispute evidence: retain longer than the dispute window (define)
- Logs: short retention with secure access (define)

## Access

- Admin UI is admin-only
- Service role use requires prior admin verification
- Sensitive exports should be tracked (who/what/when)

## GDPR/EEA basics

- define deletion/request process (what can be deleted vs what must be retained)
- provide export where required
