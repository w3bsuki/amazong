## Scope

This handoff covers `context/business/**` strategy, investor, ops, and product-planning documents.

## Checklist

- [ ] Confirm Drive folder structure for strategy / investors / ops / product.
- [ ] Export current `context/business/**` snapshot and upload to Drive.
- [ ] Set sharing and edit permissions for designated owners.
- [ ] Add Drive links back into `context/business/index.mdx` and `context/business/AGENTS.md`.
- [ ] Freeze repo copies to pointer-only notes after Drive is confirmed.

## Notes

- During migration, this tree remains archive-only and non-default for implementation.
