# Risk Register

This is a living register. Owners should review weekly during launch.

|------|------------|--------|-------|------------|
| Fraud spike (buyers/sellers) | Med | High | Ops | verification, seller limits, dispute process, monitoring |
| Chargeback rate too high | Low–Med | High | Payments | clear UX, evidence capture, quick support, policy alignment |
| Webhook failures / idempotency gaps | Med | High | Eng | idempotent handlers, event storage, alerting, replay tooling |
| Support overload | Med | High | Ops | macros, workflows, tooling in `/admin`, SLAs, self-serve help |
| Regulatory / KYC ambiguity | Med | High | Legal/Ops | lean on Stripe Connect, define policy + retention, counsel review |
| Off-platform leakage | High | Med | Product | keep fees low, improve trust messaging, reduce friction |
| Counterfeit goods | Med | High | Trust | prohibited items policy, takedowns, evidence requirements |
| Payment provider account risk | Low | High | Founders | keep dispute/chargeback low, compliance, quick response |
