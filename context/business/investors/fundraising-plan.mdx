# Fundraising Plan (Draft)

## Objective

Raise capital to reach V1 traction milestones while keeping operational risk controlled.

## What investors need (minimum)

- product narrative + differentiation
- credible unit economics model
- clear launch milestones and metrics
- risk register with mitigations
- data room basics (policies, terms drafts, financial assumptions)

## Use of funds (example buckets)

- engineering (payments reliability, seller tooling, AI assistants)
- trust & safety operations (support, moderation, fraud tooling)
- growth (SEO content, partnerships, limited paid acquisition tests)
- legal/compliance (policy review, KYC/AML guidance)

## Milestones to unlock next round

- stable payment operations (webhooks, refunds, disputes)
- acceptable dispute/chargeback rates
- growing GMV with improving retention
- proven supply/demand growth loop in 1–2 categories

## Open questions

- Target raise size and runway length (12 vs 18 months)
- Which investor profile is ideal (marketplaces vs fintech vs regional funds)?
