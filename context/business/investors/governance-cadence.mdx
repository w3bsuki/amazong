# Governance & Cadence

## Roles (baseline)

- Product: roadmap, UX, growth loops
- Engineering: reliability, payments, performance, security
- Ops/Trust: support, disputes, moderation, fraud prevention

## Weekly cadence

- Metrics review (NSM + trust metrics)
- Support/dispute review (top issues, root causes)
- Shipping plan (what is releasing this week)

## Decision process

- Write decisions as docs (DEC format) before big scope/fee changes.
- Prefer small reversible experiments.
- Keep “launch gates” explicit for payments and trust features.

## Security posture

- admin-only access enforced (server-side)
- no secrets in logs
- audit payments-related changes carefully

## Incident response (minimum)

- define severity levels
- rollback plan for payment regressions
- communication templates (internal + user-facing later)
