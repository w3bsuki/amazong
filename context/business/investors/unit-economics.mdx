# Unit Economics (Per Order)

## Goal

Prove the model can fund:

- Stripe processing costs
- support + dispute handling
- fraud loss buffer
- product development and growth

…while keeping fees low enough to avoid off-platform leakage.

## Fee model (plan-driven)

See [Monetization Model](/business/monetization) for the full fee formula, plan tables, and acceptance criteria.

In summary:
- Buyer pays a Buyer Protection fee: `min(item_price × percent + fixed, cap)`
- Business sellers pay a small seller fee: `item_price × seller_fee_percent`
- Rates are plan-driven, stored in `subscription_plans`

## Example (Personal Free, €50 item)

- Buyer fee: `min(€50×4% + €0.50, €15) = €2.50`
- Buyer total: `€52.50`
- Seller receives: `€50.00`
- Platform gross revenue (before Stripe/support): `€2.50`

## Cost buckets to track

- Stripe processing (variable + fixed)
- refunds/chargebacks (loss rate)
- support cost per dispute (time + tooling)
- fraud prevention costs (verification, monitoring)

## Contribution margin (simple model)

```
contribution = buyer_fee + seller_fee - stripe_cost - refunds_loss - support_allocation
```

## Sensitivities to monitor

- low-price orders are dominated by fixed Stripe fees → cap/fixed fee matters
- fraud spikes can wipe margin → early risk controls are critical
- support load scales with disputes, not GMV → keep dispute rate low

## Implementation requirements

See [Monetization — Acceptance Criteria](/business/monetization#acceptance-criteria) for the full checklist.
