# Investor Pack (Internal)

This section is the **management and investor-ready** documentation set for Treido Marketplace.

It is written to be:

- **specific** (clear assumptions and decisions)
- **operational** (what we do day-to-day)
- **auditable** (metrics and risks are explicit)

## What’s inside

- [One-Pager](/business/investors/one-pager) — narrative summary (problem → solution → model)
- [KPIs & Metrics](/business/investors/kpis-metrics) — what we measure and why
- [Unit Economics](/business/investors/unit-economics) — per-order margin model (fee-driven)
- [Go-to-Market](/business/investors/go-to-market) — launch strategy and growth loops
- [Risk Register](/business/investors/risk-register) — risks, owners, mitigations
- [Fundraising Plan](/business/investors/fundraising-plan) — milestones and use of funds
- [Governance & Cadence](/business/investors/governance-cadence) — how we run the company

## Current operating assumptions (can be revised)

- Launch is **full marketplace** (Vinted-style), not classifieds.
- **No cash on delivery (COD)**.
- Payments: **Stripe** + **Stripe Connect (Express)**.
- Monetization: **Buyer Protection** (buyer-paid) + **small business seller fee** (plan-driven).

## Open decisions (track and close)

- Auto-confirm after delivery: **48h vs 72h** (fraud vs UX tradeoff)
- Return shipping label policy: buyer-paid vs seller-paid vs platform-paid
- KYC/phone verification sequence: platform phone OTP before Connect onboarding vs after

> For operational planning, we mirror the key docs into `/admin/docs` (seed templates + edits).
