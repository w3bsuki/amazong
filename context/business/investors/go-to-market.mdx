# Go-to-Market (Launch → Growth)

## Objective

Launch a trusted marketplace in Bulgaria, validate retention and unit economics, then scale.

## Positioning (simple)

- **No COD**
- **Buyer Protection**
- **Verified sellers + businesses**
- **Modern UX**

## Phase 0: Supply seeding (T-30 → T-7)

- recruit trusted early sellers (quality inventory)
- onboard a small set of verified businesses (B2B supply density)
- seed “hero categories” (pick 3–5 categories where we can win)

## Phase 1: Launch (T-7 → T+14)

- controlled rollout (invite/waitlist if needed)
- daily ops monitoring (payments, disputes, fraud signals)
- tight feedback loop with early sellers

## Phase 2: Growth loops (T+14 → T+90)

- SEO: indexable listings, category pages, internal linking
- referrals: buyer invites and seller invites with incentives (later)
- creator/influencer partnerships for supply and demand
- trust marketing: publish policies + show protection clearly in checkout

## Phase 3: Scale (T+90+)

- expand categories based on GMV + retention
- introduce AI assistants (listing + search) as conversion multipliers
- add deeper business tooling (analytics, bulk listings)

## Open questions

- Which categories are our “initial wedge” (electronics, fashion, etc.)?
- What’s the initial marketing budget and CAC ceiling?
