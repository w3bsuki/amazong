# KPIs & Metrics

## North Star Metrics (NSM)

Pick a primary NSM and one secondary:

- **GMV (Gross Merchandise Value)** — total value of paid orders
- **Completed orders** — orders that reach `completed` (proxy for trust + retention)

## Core funnel (buyer)

| Stage | Metric | Definition |
|------:|--------|------------|
| Awareness | sessions | unique visits (by locale + device) |
| Intent | search rate | % sessions that perform search |
| Consideration | PDP views | product detail page views |
| Conversion | checkout start rate | checkout started / PDP views |
| Payment | paid conversion | paid orders / checkout starts |
| Fulfillment | delivered rate | delivered orders / paid orders |
| Success | completion rate | completed / paid |

## Supply funnel (seller)

- new sellers activated (listed ≥1 item)
- listing creation completion rate
- average listings per active seller
- sell-through rate (orders / active listings)

## Trust & safety metrics (non-negotiable)

- dispute rate (disputed / paid)
- refund rate (refunded / paid)
- chargeback rate (chargebacks / paid)
- counterfeit reports per 1,000 listings
- time-to-resolution for disputes

Targets (initial): keep these low enough to protect Stripe standing and brand trust.

## Unit economics metrics

- take rate (platform revenue / GMV)
- contribution margin (post-Stripe + support allocation)
- CAC payback period (if paid marketing is used)

## Operational cadence

- **Daily**: payment failures, webhook lag, dispute queue
- **Weekly**: funnel + supply metrics, GMV, top categories
- **Monthly**: unit economics review, fraud patterns, roadmap reprioritization

## Open questions

- What’s our minimum acceptable support SLA for disputes (24h vs 48h)?
- Which metrics become “stop-the-line” (e.g. chargeback spike)?
