# Boosts & Promotions

Boosts are optional paid add-ons that increase a listing’s visibility in browse/search feeds. Boosts are **never required** to sell.

## Boost SKUs (v1)

All boost charges are in **EUR** (Stripe). UI may display approximate BGN for convenience.

| SKU | Duration | Price | What you get |
|-----|----------|-------|--------------|
| `boost_24h` | 24 hours | €0.99 | Priority placement in relevant feeds for 24h |
| `boost_7d` | 7 days | €4.99 | Priority placement in relevant feeds for 7d |
| `boost_30d` | 30 days | €14.99 | Priority placement in relevant feeds for 30d |

**Plan boosts**: monthly boosts included in paid plans are **24h boost credits** (not 7d/30d boosts).

## Ranking behavior (v1)

- Boosted listings appear **before** non-boosted listings within the same feed/filter/sort.
- Among boosted listings, order is:
  1) active boosts with later `boost_expires_at` first
  2) then the feed’s normal sort (e.g. newest)
- Boosted listings must be clearly labeled (e.g. “Boosted” / “Ad”).

## Guardrails (v1)

- A listing can have **at most 1 active boost** at a time.
- Only the listing owner can purchase a boost for that listing.
- Boosts never override moderation. If a listing is removed/hidden, the boost is considered consumed.

## Refunds (v1)

- If a boost fails to activate due to platform error, provide a **refund** or **boost credit**.
- Once a boost is active/consumed, it is **non-refundable**, except for verifiable platform outages or fraud review.
