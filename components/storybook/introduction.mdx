# Amazong Component Library

Welcome to the component library. This Storybook contains all reusable UI components used across the Amazong marketplace.

## Sidebar Organization

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Introduction** | You are here – docs & getting started |
| **Design System** | Design tokens, color palette, typography |
| **Primitives** | Base shadcn/ui components (Button, Input, Card, etc.) |
| **Commerce** | E-commerce components (ProductCard, SellerBadge, etc.) |
| **Layout** | Headers, sidebars, navigation components |

## Running Storybook

```bash
pnpm storybook
```

## Building for Production

```bash
pnpm storybook:build
```

## Where Stories Live

- `components/ui/**` – shadcn primitives (Primitives category)
- `components/shared/**` – reusable composites
- `components/desktop/**` and `components/mobile/**` – platform-specific UI
- `components/storybook/**` – showcase stories for page-level components

## Workflow

1. Build or tweak a component in isolation in Storybook
2. Once it looks right, use the same component in the main app
3. Keep reusable UI in `components/**`, not one-off experiments in `app/**`

## What Needs Stories?

- **100% coverage**: `components/ui/**` primitives
- **High coverage**: `components/shared/**` reusable composites  
- **Showcase only**: Page-level components via `components/storybook/**`
