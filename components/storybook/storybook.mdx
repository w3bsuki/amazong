# Storybook workflow

Run Storybook:

```bash
pnpm storybook
```

Build Storybook (CI / deploy):

```bash
pnpm storybook:build
```

## Where stories live

- `components/ui/**` for primitives (shadcn-style building blocks)
- `components/shared/**` for reusable composites
- `components/desktop/**` (and other platform folders) for higher-level UI that’s still reusable
- `components/storybook/**` for “showcase” stories (render full pages like the Design System routes)

## How to work

1. Build or tweak a component in isolation in Storybook.
2. Once it looks right, use the same component in the main app (components are shared; stories are just a dev surface).
3. Avoid leaving one-off experiments inside `app/**` routes; keep reusable UI in `components/**`.

## What should be covered?

You don’t need Storybook stories for every `app/**` route component.

Recommended baseline:

- **100% coverage** for `components/ui/**` primitives
- **High coverage** for `components/shared/**` composites you reuse across pages
- **A few showcase pages** (like “Design System/Overview” and “Design System/V2 Sandbox”) for fast experimentation
